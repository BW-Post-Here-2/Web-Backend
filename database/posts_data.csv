6,Home,Family house size - way too big,"Hi,

I really want to hear an opinion form an community rich in US people... Do you live/have lived in a house > 5000 sq ft? Would it be considered ""normal"" in US to have a 5k sq ft home /w office for a family of 5?

What are/were the disadvantages?  
What are/were the advantages?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Long part:

I have ""designed"" my 2nd house/floor plans -- I mean: I have drawn a new version of my ""dream house"" floor plans for a new parcel with a much better ratio (width/length) than my previews attempt (described below)... The result came to a total of 5060sq ft on 2 floors!!! That is one insane number! No one in his right mind would build a house that big! But i love it... I just can not force myself to redo it and reduce the size to some still enormous 3500 - 3700 sq ft.

Is anybody here living in such a big house? Do you regret your decision buying such house? I mean, from the 5060 sq ft, there is 565 sq ft home office... So the actual \_home\_ is about 4477 sq ft, which is still enormous probably even for the USA!

There is still a very big possibility i will not be able to afford such an big building, but i am lucky to live in an ""easternish"" part of central Europe and the cost of constructing a new house is a lot cheaper than in the neighboring countries. And this worsens the situation as if i will be able to convince a bank to finance it, i might really do it.

Extra long part:

We live (2 adults, 3 kids \[3, 5, 7y\], 5 cats) in an 1614sq ft family house right now. We do both mostly work from home and i ""need"" much space (company storage) which i do not have enough of... I hate this house, it just feels very small for my needs.

So we were working for almost 10 years to ""legally settle"" some parcels (2.5 Acres in total), but it was on the narrow side (60 foot wide and veeery long)... I always wanted to exchange it in some way with the neighboring parcel owners to get more reasonable dimensions/ratio, but they were against it.

So i have thought about a possible house/floor plan for a log time and maybe after 100 iterations come to a ""final"" floor plan which used the narrow spot perfectly and the total usable size was just under 3700 sq ft. I was very very happy with the design as it used the proportions of the parcel effectively, i just hated the general house placement, as the house would be near to both neighbors.

So i was still unhappy about the fact, that we will be looking into the neighbors gardens and even standing there in the middle of the parcel was sometimes like listening to 2 separate sound sources somewhere near, with still noticeable words, but having different programs on (summer evenings, both neighbors outside on their patio).

So i have managed to talk one neighbor into dividing and exchanging some parcels and after one more year of negotiations, we got another part of the land, where our parcel is 157 ft wide... To convince this neighbor i had to accept the far side from the street (which i always wanted), so i have only 78 ft left where we can build on... But hey, the spot i can build on is still 157 x 78 ft... and if the house will be wide and short, it will be looking onto a veeery big garden.

So after everything was settled, i started drawing new floor plans from scratch. After another 100 iterations, i have managed to get a result i liked... I mean i really like it! I do love it! I love it so much, i have a problem to return my expectation to reality!"

12,Home,Recommended Retractable/Removable Way to Cover This Skylight?,"Hello, I currently live in a loft-style apartment in California with no A/C.

In my home office is a skylight in the ceiling that looks like this: https://imgur.com/a/9ZAuXye

It's about 6' x 5' I'd say. It's about a foot deep. There's a screen covering and a mechanism with a crank pole that I can put in to open and close the window.

It's cooking me alive in the mornings, which normally wasn't a huge problem in a pre-quarentine work from home world but it's starting to become an issue.

What would be the easiest solution for something that I could install that would let me remove/retract when needed to give me access to the window? (It's nice to have it open during the day when the sun isn't out.)"

The first round of carpet I cleaned two Saturdays ago made a huge impact not just from how gross the water was, but my three-year-old’s cough at night is almost gone. The air feels cleaner. It’s incredible! I was so amazed I waited one week and decided to do a second round last Saturday, however, the water was just as dirty and dark. I was a bit discouraged seeing it hasn’t cleared up even a little. I’m wanting to do a third round next week but I have a feeling that would be overdoing it. Especially with us renting, I don’t want to do ANYTHING that would compromise the carpets as far as mold goes... thoughts? Comments? What is the typical time gap for cleaning carpets yourself? All I have found is that “you should get your carpets professionally cleaned once a year”. I would appreciate solid advice or anyone who’s experienced this."

31,Home,"Is my crawlspace flooded? No idea, but I need help!"," Hi folks - so I have a weird pickle.

I  am a new homeowner and am very bad at DIY/home maintenance. The house  was a gift that I wasn't really involved in/didn't have any say in, so I  wasn't around for things like home inspection or anything like that,  though I do have the report. Notably, the home inspector said they could  not access the crawlspace.

The  yard has always flooded like crazy when it rains, standing water for a  couple days after bad rains. Usually it's mostly just the yard, but it's  been raining for a few days straight here, and there's lots of standing  water around about 2.5 edges of the house. I ran into my neighbors this  morning running around because they have about 13 inches of water in  their crawlspace. They're freaking out, pumping, making runs to home  improvement stores, etc.

That  really concerned me. Our crawlspace is boarded up for some reason - we  didn't even know where/how to access it until we had a plumbing issue  and found out it seems to be sealed/boarded up underneath some of our  kitchen drawer units. At the time, the plumber thought he might have to  bust it open, but was able to solve the issue without doing so. He noted  that it probably would have been a big production to open it up and  reseal it.

So, two questions...

1. Is there a way to tell if there's flooding without busting into the crawlspace? I don't notice any damp or watery odor.
2. What  would you do if you were me? I ordered some Quick Dam Flood bags to  just stack around the edges of the house as a quick and janky solution  to curb whatever is going on, though that's really just a panic buy  because in the past it hadn't even occurred to me that this was a  problem and we've had conditions similar to this before (though perhaps  not this extreme).
3. Is this an emergency? Should I be running around like my neighbors?
4. Any idea how much money I could be looking at to do any or all of whatever the solution might be?

Forgive  me if this post seems totally ignorant, but I am new at being  responsible for this stuff and feeling totally out of my league."

33,Home,Gas boilers: could this be dangerous?,"Hi all, I'm trying to understand something more about gas boilers and if what I have in mind is dangerous or not. The house was under renovation work and I could not follow everything because of other problems. Now that it is almost finish I'm checking everything and I'm trying to understand if there could be a problem with the following situation\_

The house is divided in two apartments, both have a kitchen and both a have a gas boiler connected to radiators and to the shower / sinks.  The gas boilers have a 24 kw power each and the maximum limit of power that I can get from the gas company is 35 kw, unless I spend a lot of money for other things and certifications.

I know that kitchen gas consumption would be around 12-20 kW for the 2 kitchens (total). I m thinking to change the gas boiler and to buy another one, a more powerful one, maybe the 35 kw one.

If the  gas company set a limit of 35 kw, and I'm using the 35 kw gas boiler  (everything turned on) plus the gas consumed by the kitchens (suppose 15) kw, for a total of 50 kw, what would happen? something wouldn't work? the house would blow up? gas would not be connected in my case?

Any suggestion?"

We loved the house otherwise and put in an offer which was accepted.  We gave our earnest money and scheduled the inspection for 2 days after they were supposed to be finished with the repair. Well the inspector gets there and they weren’t finished with the repairs to the water leak and subsequent wood rot and, unbeknownst to me, my agent told him to do the inspection anyway.  I drive by  the house after I got the inspection report and it said they weren’t finished, Dude is still working.  Something seems off.  3 days later my realtor sends me a report saying everything is fixed.  I ask to have my contractor look at it and he goes up and put his thumb through one of the dormers!  Also when we enter the house to check the leak, we find out that the HVAC went out.  My realtor says by law I have to give them another 5 days to fix everything but I feel like they are just going to make shitty repairs again and want to move on from this house.

One of the issues is that the worktop joint isn't flush. One of the worktop sections is a little higher than the other part. Probably a 3mm difference but I'm worried that water will get in or the laminate chip.

The project manager said it could be caused by current carcases (?uneven carcases), and even the slightest discrepancy could cause this to happen. 

Is this a load of rubbish?? Should I demand that they reset the worktop? How would they be able to rectify this issue? Would they have to replace the whole worktop?

Any advice would be most appreciated. Thanks for your time. Regards,

47,Home,[Discussion] Thinking about taking down a set of barn doors & replacing it with cabinet doors,"So we have this set of barn doors for the pantry & and coffee station (it came with the house). I would like to have this taken down and order doors that match the kitchen for the tall pantry cabinet beside the coffee station. I'd like to take down the barn doors for a few reasons:

1-  It's quite noisy (like rumbling thunder which cam be heard from the upstairs) and the one screw at the top binds so every time somebody slides the doors it makes a banging sound.

2- Since we always use the coffee bar area, it's barn door is always on the pantry side, so whenever we need to take something in or out of the pantry, we always have to slide the 2 doors at the same time. And no one (including myself) likes to slide both doors back again to close the pantry.

3 - With point number 2 above, nobody can ever use the coffee station and the pantry at the same time.

4 - Drawer & doors in the coffee bar area always hit the side of one of the doors when opened

5 - Barn doors leave about foot of gap (see picture) in the pantry side. So everyone can see what's in our pantry from the living room. I think this defeats the purpose of having a door at all. I just want to be able to close the pantry completely so it doesn't look cluttered.

So although, it looks really pretty, to me it's just not functional. We've gotten a lot of compliments about it and seems to be the focal point of the house, but I'd rather have cabinet doors to make everything convenient and functional. Also, the barn door trend might get outdated a few years from now so I'd rather have it updated now for me to enjoy rather than update it when we decide to sell, if ever.

There's a few downside to having new cabinet doors in place:

1 - it's going to cost us $500

2- we have to remove the tracks at the top so the wall will need some patching up, but the real problem would be guides screwed on to the floor which leave holes and I'm not sure how to patch that properly.

3-The new cabinet doors will be about 2 inches wider than the ones on the coffee station, so I'm not sure if that's going to be an issue.

My spouse thinks, that because of the cost, it might not be worth it. So I am asking for a general third party opinion on this. Is there an alternative to cabinet doors? There  are intake vents underneath both sides of the areas so that's why cabinets were the best choice.

I know some of the first things you want to do is save up a deposit for a house and work or your credit right? I'm planing on saving up 10k to 15k and if at all possible 20k. My credit is about 677, I acquired alot of debt when I was younger and had to pay that off before I could get my score up.

Will student loans affect my ability to purchase a house?

Its not just me purchasing it, my boyfriend is helping aswell. He has zero credit so we are working on getting him a secure credit card. We do plan on getting married eventually, court house wedding, will that benefit us purchasing a house together?

I know once I have my down payment I need to be pre-approved for a mortgage yes? What interests rate should I be looking for? What options are there for new home buyers?

Investors take these homes and turn them into rental properties that are absurdly overpriced and here we our, both in our 30's, squirreling away our money to put down a nice hefty down payment and some investor comes in and buys out the property in cash. You can't compete with that!  The way I see it is that these investors are already making a pretty penny if they can afford to buy houses outright, so why can they not be satiated with the money that they are already making from all of the other properties they have bought up. We just lost another house today. We aren't going to ask $50,000 over ask price and waive the appraisal."
81,Home,"So I live in a super old house, it was done up by my parents when the moved in, How would I dampen my room as in they can't hear me as much in the room below me, I had ugly vinly on but took it off any tips?",
82,Home,"If you had the option of buying a house with new siding or the ability to pick the new siding, which would you go with?","Wife and I are thinking of selling our house to build a new one (if it doesn't sell, we'll rent it out).

We have a couple Reno's left that include A/C and siding. But my thought was, would potential buyers prefer to pick the siding? It could be a stipulation in the agreement that we would get the siding installed before they take possession and get to pick colours.

Or would you rather see a house with new siding?

Thanks for your thoughts and opinions."
83,Home,Extra Room In Master Bedroom,"https://imgur.com/a/4fG3hxm


   Not sure what to do with this room and looking for advice. We moved in to our new home yesterday and we are struggling with this room. It’s another room in the master bedroom. It does have clear doors when closing. The master bedroom has a master bathroom and walk in closet.  
   At first I thought it was an office space, but there is built in office space in a loft area upstairs, the other bedroom upstairs has office space built in. Downstairs has another portioned off office with bathroom and closets. 
   The master bathroom is missing an important feature, a linen closet. Also there is no medicine cabinet. All of this is odd to me as the second bedroom upstairs has an ensuite bathroom which has a closet. 
  It feels odd to me to turn it into a wardrobe or additional closet given the clear doors but I am open!"
84,Home,Is this damp or anything?,
85,Home,What is this style of trim called? Need to replace the rotting wood over the garage. I would love to figure out how to add bold thick trim like the picture on the left in white to black on mine as the new planks will be cedar or painted slate. Any tips or help! Thanks/,
86,Home,Anyone know how to clean the unzippable part of an Ikea mattress?,"I have an ikea mattress and the cover badly needs cleaning (it's my fault, I should be more careful!), but I was wondering how I would go about doing this. I've seen a lot of different methods and stories but none were on reliable-looking websites."
87,Home,Ants! What kind? What should I do?,"Just moved in last month. Spotted immediately. We have  used Terri ant traps, seem to work for a week and then they are back!

This is our back window and floor  which abuts our posterior wall and then backyard!"
88,Home,Water in basement,"I just bought my first house. We’re not even moved in yet. Today it’s raining and I noticed water in a puddle in 2 places on my basement floor. Not near walls. The kicker is my basement is finished. One of the major reasons we bought the house. So we don’t know where we even start with remedying this. Call insurance, can we go after the sellers? And not to mention how this is fixed. I’m assuming our finished basement will be torn up. I’m so upset right now. My dream home that I have yet to move into is starting to become a nightmare."
89,Home,Reflecting this lockdown. What do you consider to be the most important room in a house?,
90,Home,My neighbors put these handmade mask out for anyone that needs one. That’s kind of them.,
91,Home,How much to save before moving out,"Basically, I'm 15 and live with my mum and her boyfriend and my bros and sis. I wanna move out ASAP. When I leave school and get a job at 16, if I'm making £1000 a month then how long until I'm ready to move? I found multiple apartments that are furnished and that charge £500 a month, how much should I save for rent, food, electric, Internet and just needs and wants in general. Pretty much what I mean is how long until I can leave without any worries? Thanks guys"
92,Home,Drywall Removal,Some drywall in the basement was removed to fix a leaking pipe. I'd like to cover the areas of missing drywall with a fabric that would prevent heat loss until the drywall is replaced. Any ideas?
93,Home,Any ideas on what keeps reappearing on the ceiling? It was cleaned away and sprayed with insect killer but came back.,
94,Home,Make Bleach Smell Go Away?,"So due to an issue with a smell in a room my dad poured bleach in the pipes and now chlorine gas is stinking up the room and stinking up the whole upstairs floor as well. We’ve tried opening up the windows, turning on fans, closing the door to the room and on top of that even closjng the vent we think its coming from. We thought it was just coming from that one room but even when we closed off that room the smell still permeates the halls especially at night for some reason. It really puzzles me why the smell gets so strong at night. Its been here for 5 days and is even starting to get into my bedroom (the only room that hasnt been tainted by the smell). How do we get rid of it now? Especially now that we can’t call anyone to fix it because of you know what"
95,Home,"Is Homeowners Insurance different than ""Home Insurance""?","Sorry for the question. I'm sure its dumb. But I'm a first time home buyer and to my knowledge, Homeowner's Insurance is required. This covers ""dwelling"" and other personal property. But do I need to buy separate ""Home Insurance"" as well? Such as some insurance that covers roof damage or any weather damage? Or does Homeowners Insurance cover all of that? Thanks ahead of time!"

98,Home,DIY *OLD* KITCHEN RENOVATION - IDEAS? TIPS?,"Hi there, first post here! I would like to get feedback and suggestions for my very old, ooold kitchen. Specifically what material to use to paint/cover/stick the hideousness that you can see in the following link.

God only knows what layers hide behind what you see but currently it seems like the previous tenant just used some sort of sticker wallpaper.  
&nbsp;

**Question:** should I remove the sticker or paint/restick on it? 

(my hunch is to *not* remove the sticker - [see in this photo] (⊙﹏⊙✿)(https://imgur.com/ky4af2T) how there's a pannel above the door? That's after I removed the sticker that was on it)

What material *do* I use? 


Brace yourselves....(˚☐˚! )/

My name is Jonathan Herzog and I’m a Democrat running for Congress in New York’s 10th District (the west side of Manhattan   south Brooklyn). 

COVID-19 is causing a 9/11 death toll every single day. We’ve entered a new Great Depression. More than 40 million Americans are unemployed. Yet Congress has been on recess. If New York had shut down just 10 days sooner, up to 80% of all deaths could have been avoided. Our politicians have been asleep at the switch. 

We need to wake up. We need a Representative with 21st century solutions for 21st century crises. I won’t sit back as we watch our city and country burn and say, “we’re fucked.”

I’m a civil rights organizer and legal advocate born and raised on the border of Hell’s Kitchen and the Upper West Side. I was part of the founding team that built Andrew Yang’s 2020 presidential campaign, joining as the 6th hire, helping get Yang on Rogan, qualify for the DNC debates, and bring universal basic income to the mainstream. 

We need a new generation of Freedom Democrats committed to fighting for deep freedom, not shallow equality. To raise the floor, not lower the ceiling. To build the future, not find others to blame. 

Universal basic income may not solve every problem, but it makes every problem easier to solve. 

If we get just 2% of all New Yorkers in the 10th District (15,000 people) to vote for our vision by June 23rd, we’ll win the seat.

526,ChoosingBeggars,CB acts like a child in KFC,"I worked at a KFC and A&W at my hometown. Honestly it was my first job and I had just graduated from school. I was working the register one day and at this time, we kind of had an issue with the ventilation above us. The ceiling tiles in the lobby were kind of turning black from all the water that was leaking. Regardless of this, we didn’t really hear too many complaints about it because we were always quick on giving food. So I was minding my own business at the register when a customer, (C) decided to come strolling in.

Me- Hi! What can I get for ya?

C- *places his ginormous order*

(The order came out to be at least $60+)

Me- Alright your total is $63.89

C- Um...where’s my discount?

Me- Well sir, we only offer discounts to seniors here.

C- That’s bullshit. I’m not paying that much for food and eating in here. Look at this place it’s disgusting. I won’t be paying a single cent.

Me- Well no offense but, we can’t do that. It’s your choice whether or not you want to eat here or have it to go.

C- No. I want to eat here and I’m not paying that much for my food. 

Me- I’m sorry sir, but we don’t give out free food.

C- Fuck you buddy. I hope you get hit by a bus.

The CB decides to storm out and in a fit of rage he decided to act like a 9 year old and throw the wet floor sign across the lobby. I had a long line of customers and honestly I felt embarrassed for them. 

I told him “Oh that’s mature buddy”

He replied with “Up yours fat ass.”

My manager heard the commotion and she asked what was up. I told her what happened and she was so angry that she marched out in the parking lot and yelled that he was banned from coming back to our location. The customer that was after him was a really nice lady and she was so apologetic. We exchanged stories of other customers and had a good laugh about it in the end. I didn’t stay there long though. Only about six months. I ended up moving to working retail...but that’s another story for another day."

At the front of the store, there are bottles of hand sanitizer, hand soap, and face masks. Note that all of these are the store brand.

I'm waiting on line to pay and I see a heavily pregnant woman eying the hand sanitizer. She frowns and walks out. 

A few seconds later, her husband (?) comes in, without a face mask, and literally screams out loud to the cashier (who was helping a customer): ""Where is the Purell?""

Cashier: ""This is all we have at the moment.""  

Guy: ""I don't use generic products! They're not good enough!"" 

Then he stormed out.

I finished paying and saw him and his wife (with two little kids in the car) cackling about the hand sanitizer (windows open and I speak their language) while still parked in the lot for some reason (?)

Like, it's the same ingredients? What's so bad about generic product? Also, sending your preggo wife in first?

I scan it and it comes up on sale and just let him know sometimes we don't always have the sale tags up in time for sale day. He relaxes.

As I'm totaling up he goes ""can I have another twenty-five percent off because the prices aren't done?""

I tell him the sale is already a really good deal as these particular figurines very rarely go on sale at all. He says ""are you joking?"" while sighing loudly and patting his pockets, eventually tossing a few bills on the counter after I kept waiting and he realized it wasn't going to be any cheaper and then taking the figurine and starting to walk away.

He's a good ten dollars short so I call loudly ""Sir, you're short!""

He doesn't stop walking so I yell, thinking he's hard of hearing, ""SIR, YOU'RE SHORT. MAY I HAVE THE OTHER TEN DOLLARS, PLEASE?""

He kind of shuffles at the entrance, rolls his head on his shoulders like he's trying to compose himself and comes back and says, while getting angry again, ""listen, I'm trying not to lose it with you but you're not doing the customer service bit very much justice here. It's ten dollars. Can't you just give me fifty percent off like we talked about?""

I tell him it's not fifty percent off and that he can come back later when he has the money but the store doesn't do additional discounts and I politely request the figurine back. He tucks it under his arm and then suddenly yells in my face ""I PAID FOR IT. YOU HAVE THE MONEY.""

I got really scared because I just can't handle grown ass men (he looks like he's about fifty, thinning buzz cut, pretty tall, works out) yelling at me and just looked at the money on the counter and said quietly ""you're ten dollars short, sorry.""

At this point he just takes the figurine and slams it into the ground so hard it damages the box (edit: and grabs the bills he left back) and lets out a bellowing roar ""I hope you LOSE YOUR FUCKING JOOOOOOOOOOOB!!"" then leaves, ignoring the managers who try to get him to come back.

I pretty much felt like crying but I didn't. I just put the figurine aside because it's so damaged we have to mark it down by about fifty percent.

He's not getting it."

561,ChoosingBeggars,I was a choosing beggar,"Alright, storytime. Let's go back at least eight or so years to when I was around 11-12 years old. At that time, I was really into writing and wanted to make a comic, but I didn't have the art skills. So I went on DeviantArt and contacted some artists whose art I really admired.

Now I was a kid in a third world country where even a single dollar is enough to buy a full course meal. I definitely did not have any money at all to pay an artist and I knew that. So little me thought a compromise would be that we collaborated on a comic. I'd do all the story writing and plot building, and all they'd have to do was draw it. To me, it was a good compromise. 

I was firmly rebuffed by the artists who told me that they needed to be paid. And one of them, to their credit, was kind enough to properly explain to me why the commission money mattered and offered to lower her prices a bit for a couple of sketched pages. Well that didn't end up going through because my dad was like ""paying for art? Hell no.""

Today I've begun developing my own art skill and have opened commissions myself. While I haven't received any such offers or begging for free art, I now appreciate what artists have to go through much more. It's been a lot of time, so those artists have left the site and I can't find them anymore, but if I could, I wish I could apologize for taking their time and effort for granted. 

Tl;dr, a well meaning kid reached out to artists and became a choosy beggar but was taught a lesson"

580,ChoosingBeggars,My moms story about work today,"Ok, today at work, I had a customer that had me about to really speak my mind to get rude with me. Ever since this pandemic started in March, the policy at work is 2 meats. You can get 2 packages of fresh chicken, 2 beef and 2 pork. This policy has not changed and we have had signs on bright yellow cards on the doors entering the building and all along the meat section.  This is nothing new, so one would figure that people would know how to read by now. Well this gentleman, who is already buying 12 pints of Ben and Jerry's and a bunch of other stuff has got 3 packages of ground pork. So I politely tell him that we have a limit of 2, that I am unable to sell him more than that. Well he tends to go off, phrasing what everyone else has said, I got a family of 6 (which it seems 6 is this lucky number for i never hear any other number from customers). I tell him I am sorry, but it has been this way since everything has started. He continues to go on and tells me that we should have signs up to let people know. About this time I am irritated and I tell him we do. We have signs on both the doors and all along the meat department. He tells me he saw no signs and that he is going to check for all he saw on the front door was the no rainchecks sign (which is on white paper, unlike the eye catching yellow the 2 limit sign is on so I know he saw the sign). He huffs and tells me he just might have the mind and walk out and leave his cart full of groceries there that I am still ringing up. So I step back with the look of OK, go ahead, but he continues to load food on the belt. He checks out and leaves my register and a few minutes later he is back at my station to tell me that there is no sign by the ground meat. I just ignore him and carry on with my new customer. Then later I hear that after he left me, he started getting rude to one of my other coworkers and store manager,  who even check and lord and behold, there was a sign by the meat. 
So now there is either 2 or 3 new signs at the doors, so they won't be missed (as long as people can read) and more by the meat.

605,leagueoflegends,Smurfing is the equivalent of an adult stepping into a kids basketball game,"You can't compete against people of your level so you stomp on kids to make yourself feel good at the game. No one else has a good time and you ruin the game for people genuinely trying to just play a game at their skill level. Also you look scummy and pathetic to others. I remember seeing a post about a gold twitch with over 200 games played and 100% win rate. Why is something like that allowed to happen in this game?



Edit: When referring to smurfing, I am talking about people purposely creating an account to stomp on lower brackets for fun, iron-Challenger challenges for example or for Clash. I am not talking about making an alternate account to get better at a new role without screwing up your main account. If you make a new account and genuinely try in Placements I don't think you're part of the problem."

614,leagueoflegends,Comparing the League of Legends event passes," There are a lot of players upset with the state of the pass and it's value compared to other games. I'd say there are even more people who don't care about the League pass and it's nerfs and other's who go as far as defending it.

&#x200B;

I really want this community to take a look at this page: [https://www.dota2.com/international/battlepass](https://www.dota2.com/international/battlepass)

&#x200B;

All the new content. All the stuff to unlock. And plenty of time to do it. For 10 dollars.

&#x200B;

Riot  needs to step up their game. It's embarrassing that Riot is getting  away with being so damn cheap. Our pass is more expensive, expires in a  month, and we get a disgustingly less amount of rewards. We get a measly  recycled game mode as well to go along with them.

&#x200B;

It's  okay to be happy with your purchase In League of Legends for your event  pass. But you really need to take a look at what the possibilities are  here. You could be getting so much more and so much more fun out of it."
615,leagueoflegends,I commissioned a full concept and splash for an Eclipse Aatrox skin.,"[twitter thread](https://twitter.com/aatroxesq/status/1264230536958140420?s=21)

So I may have gone too wild with this, but I wanted to see it exist somehow, even though Riot probably won’t make it.

I commissioned Nebura, a very skilled artist who is on the sub with some frequency - his stuff is great - to make the concept sheet with abilities and in-game mockup. This was based on a splash art made by an artist called Luzdanaee, who is honestly a saint for being able to distill my rambling and a slew of various reference images into a cohesive concept.

I based the references I provided on things I had learned about from Notquitefrodo and Stellari as to things that sort of inspired a little of the eclipse line, and then Nebura added the elements that made it more in-line with Riot’s visual guidelines and language.

A little of it is just my personal taste (primarily the sword) but I tried to adhere to what would fit the skin line and game, while making sure it still looks like Aatrox."

Earlier this evening i checked the new amazing honor 5 rewards, they are disgusting. TWO pink chromas for the ugliest skins i've ever seen, not a new skin, a special kind of border or an icon, 2 ugly chromas.

The vision of those ""rewards"" itself made me wanna flame just to lock my honor and never see a reward like that. 

Good players should be actually rewarded (at least a little bit, i understand you have to be good by default), but most importantly bad people should be banned, which is not happening.

But there is no punishment system there that works. I have even tried website ticket reporting only to be told that “we can’t handle this right now we are closing the ticket”. - which I get. 

So I have an idea, why not recreate the afk punishment so that you do not lose lp if someone leaves afk? Or they introduce a better afk ban system like CSGO has? 

It seems pretty unfair that I have to sit and play a 45 min game 4v5 and they get no punishment at all. (I have reported each instance and no punishment has been given). 

It’s pretty frustrating and making league almost unplayable solo/duo for me right now.

638,leagueoflegends,What are the unintuitive parts of your main's playstyle?,"As an example, I main Viktor, whose early game revolves around getting a hex core as his first buy.

To get the upgrade on first back, he might overstay in lane or burn his mana too fast, and thus not be able to make use of his lv6 powerspike - this property can sometimes make lv6 Viktor's most vulnerable point, while 7 is his safest.

It's a very specific set of circumstances, and it makes Viktor play different early on than most people might expect him to.

Almost every game of URF looks the same, though it has no much potential. You're just left off going with the tryhard wave because not doing so results in getting outclassed by stronger picks and stronger builds. You can't really ""try out"" new champs because Jhin just runs around with 50000ms and OS's you with 4 IE's.

Since the original essence of URF was trying out new champs and find fun mechanics, people played most champs and then took the best one's because winning is fun right? So, why not go with new fun items that are extending fun mechanics and let people try out new stuff?

Being able to zhonyas your teammate or an enemy, an empowered half global Tristana ult or an item that gives you an super high MS buff. It has a lot of potential and i think it would bring new wind into this game mode. This originally fun gamemode just becomes so much toxic more and more"
652,leagueoflegends,Why can't Spirit Guard Udyr have his stances upgraded at rank 5 like he used to?,"Hello there,

First and foremost I wanted to state that I don't want this post to have anything to do with commenting on the current state of Udyr, I just wanted to make my point and hopefully y'all will join me in on this one.

So what's the big deal? The Spirit Guard Udyr skin has always had two forms of every stance, one that he would start with and one that would replace the default one after maxing out a certain stance.

About a year ago, Udyr got a mini-rework enabling him to put up to 6 points in each ability. Now from what I remember, this at first didn't affect the skin dynamic and so he still needed only 5 points in a stance to ""upgrade"" it. But Riot decided to change it.

Why? I don't know. I guess the whole maxing out theme had to be kept up with and it's pretty understandable, but there's one huge issue and that's average game length.

Getting your stances unleashed at levels 16/17/18 compared to the previous 9/11/15 is a total bummer. With all the changes such as turret platings and double Rift Herald, nearly half of the games end before you upgrade even one of your stances and it's completely underwhelming.

I really think that this skin is one of the coolest skins in the whole game, but why even bother choosing it if you'll be looking way worse than (for example) the Dragon Oracle Udyr for the vast majority of the game if not even for the whole game if it ends before you reach lvl 16.

Now why does that even matter? Because it's one of the few ultimate skins and it should have it's justice, especially if the whole change boils down to pretty much swapping a single digit in the code.

Anyways, here are some pictures if you guys wanted to see each of the stances and their upgrades. Lemme know what your thoughts are.

Stay safe, I'm out.

\[Edit 1\]

First of all, thanks for showing so much interest in this topic. Now since u/JawaJuic3 actually tweeted at Riot and they responed asking for suggestions, I thought I'd make a poll so we can see where we all stand in this. Here are the options I came up with:

Option 1 - Just revert the changes, make the stances evolve at rank 5.

Option 2 - Revert the changes and add an option to turn the evolutions off at all. Now that's because like u/XoXeLo stated, this skin actually gives up info about what the player is maxing and given that it only happens while using this particular skin, some people might not want it at all.

Option 3 - Allow the player to choose his evolves after reaching 6/11/16. A simple overlay over the champion icon, hit 6, evolve bear and you're good. Now that's cool because you can evolve different stuff each game but might feel clunky when u get the evolved Bear Stance while it's still rank 1

Option 4 - Evolve them all at a certain lvl, like 10 or 11.

655,leagueoflegends,Anivia wall suggestion,"Hey, as an Anivia main I believe changing the way Anivia forms her wall would make its use more interesting. 

As of now, the wall is created relative to her position. If you want create a wall, it is always created on a circumference, with the center being Anivia. In other words, if you create a wall, place a midpoint on it and trace the line to where Anivia is, this line will always be perfectly perpendicular to the wall. This limits the possibilities of creating smart entryways, blocking paths, etc.

Considering the prevalence of dashes and just for the sake of interesting gameplay, consider the following change - make the wall's placement work like Rumble's ultimate. This would allow total freedom over the angle the wall is placed. As an Anivia main, this would be an exciting change. It would take slightly longer to wall, but I believe it'd be worth it.

658,leagueoflegends,The Reason Ranked feels terrible is because the game is lost very quickly.,"All the people you see afk and quit within ten minutes after feeding, or people just giving up, is because the game, ever since Runes Reforged, has conditioned us that the game ends fast. And that anyone who plays through after the game is 0-10 in the enemy's favor means at least a 5 to 10K gold difference (plates really make this snowball even greater). At that point, you're just playing a waiting game for the enemy to end the game. And for those who say you can make a comeback, this isn't season 5 or earlier. If the player gave up a large amount of kills, and don't know how to minimize falling behind, they won't be making a comeback.

If you die five times in laning phase, whether it's you or a teammate, you know the game is over for that player. Asking them to keep playing is too much, at least in solo ranked. As much as we would love people to have a sense of toughness in League, there is no incentive to make comebacks and spend another 15 to 20 minutes to keep playing. Dragons, Heralds, plates, soft towers, and minions getting faster and stronger every 5 minutes,makes pushing a lead very easy for the winning team. Remember, Riot literally said when they added these mechanics that they wanted to make game shorter by giving the winning team more options to close a game. So here we are. I don't know why everyone is surprised this was the result.

So for everyone and Riot who asked for faster games, this is your result. People give up faster when there is no incentive to keep playing out a game. At this point, Riot should make surrender be allowed sooner, without the unanimous decision."

665,leagueoflegends,Idea/What if: Traditional Chroma,"As someone who enjoys playing less popular champions, having characters reworked is both a blessing and a curse. You often times lose not only the gameplay of the character but their look as well, and the traditional skins for champions used to be a way of at least keeping some of the pre-rework champion. Riot, understandably, found this to be a bit of a waste of time and money, so traditional skins have been discontinued.   


I've seen people float the idea around of base skin chromas colored similarly to the old champion design, and while I doubt any such thing will ever actually be done, I just felt like making a quick mock-up of what something like this could look like for some reworked champions.  Pretty simple and hastily done, but I just wanted to fantasize about what it could look like if Riot ever did do something like this.

668,leagueoflegends,"Custom Games created League of Legends, and minimal changes to LoL's custom games could allow them to have similar potential.","Every time permanent game modes were reformed (RIP Twisted Treeline and Dominion), Riot has argued that sustaining these in custom games wouldn't be viable, because the pay off would be to continue allocating space for them in the servers and maintaining functionalities when new content is added. 

However, I believe the only pay off evaluated was the immediate one. Let's go back to the first two seasons of League. Back then, Custom Games thrived with ideas, one of which resulted in the permanent game mode ARAM.

Like ARAM, there were a plethora of gamemodes created by the community, such as Find the Teemo, Hide and Seek and Protect the King, that are still, after **8 years**, finding lobbies in custom games. Later in time, other gamemodes surfaced from allowing One for All and URF into custom gamemodes, ideas that were refined and also yielded official gamemodes such as Dark Star: Singularity.

I say all of this because League of Legends the game was created as a response to a custom WoW game, and because Riot's second project Teamfight Tactics was also a response to a custom DotA game. 

We have proof that allowing players to express their creativity in the LoL sphere can create secondary gamemodes that keep the players engaged. So I argue that the pay off for maintaining custom gamemodes with more ample options, even if they break from time to time and create one or two headaches, can yield a pay off much greater than nostalgia trips, but can open the world of possibilities for the future of League.

***

TL;DR: League comes from WoW custom game, TFT comes from a DotA custom game. ARAM comes from a LoL custom game. As such, supporting custom games with more (existing) maps and functionalities shouldn't be brushed aside because it takes some server space."

681,leagueoflegends,I played with a Rioter in solo queue...gave me an idea to possibly improve the experience.,"I queued up for my ranked game and was kind of happy to find that a Rioter was on my team. This gave me a sense of security that the other 8 players in the game would think twice before flaming or trolling. As we played the game, absolutely no one, if at all maybe there was 1 or two messages during the game. No all chat being used on both sides. It was a nice change of pace because it seems like every game there is always some type of toxicity going on. When we reached post game screen after our victory, it was the same, just ""GG's"" and harmless banter. Overall greatest experience for a league game I have ever had in the past few months.

I added the Rioter and to my surprise, they added me back. He expressed to me that he's even been told ""to kill himself""..etc.. That the flaming still happens if they're in the games. Logically, to me both sides make sense. Flaming would still inevitably happen, while I also believe the presence of an actual Rioter does help the issue and acts as an active presence/deterrent from negative behavior. 

What I also found interesting...is that the Rioter also said that they used to have a direct line for support, to make things go quicker to issue punishments to people who are blatantly trolling/verbally abusive in games...this system was taken away from them so they pretty much have to go through the same route as anyone else, which is the classic support ticket. Given the recent light of things, it's kind of a slap to the face given how vocal some pros have been regarding these issues and they just decide to take away something that helped the issue! Really crazy to me.

Besides the point..having a Riot presence in my game gave me the idea that having people with the Riot prefix before their name would help lobbies.
What if  Riot deployed a program..that only selects very specific and trust able people after a vetting process to have some players across every division with a Riot prefix. While, there can be a handful of counter arguments to this, one being that if this power is abused and somehow a toxic person ends up with the Riot prefix...I'd say if done correctly and in a very specific way with procedure, would work. As for being a player with a Riot prefix, the player would also receive some sort of compensation..whether that be champions/skins/runepages/RP/BE/$?

EDIT: I'm not talking about LIVE in-game punishment. I'm talking purely about a active presence in games that would serve as a deterrent. If anything negative happens in games that is a reportable offence, actions would be taken post-game. 

EDIT 2: Some people mentioned Tribunal in comments. Tribunal was a fairly passive system. Having someone in-game would serve as an active deterrent because it's concrete and in-front of your face. Tribunal was a system to take action, on people who had reports submitted on them. This kind of system that I am talking about would be more like mosquito repellent. ""Rito is watching"" vibes.

EDIT 3: User ""SulkyJoe"" said "" I think that could be something more valid. Maybe not with the Riot prefix, I really don't think Riot would do that, but could have them marked in someway, and have the get high prio reports."" 
Good idea I think!

EDIT 4: I've noticed some comments saying that I want a referee type person. Nope! What I'm simply saying is that if there was an active presence of someone with a Riot tag it may deter people from doing X behavior."

684,leagueoflegends,Why are people fine with smurfing?,"I srsly dont get it why is smurfing allowed, or at least why a Dimond smurf needs to stopm all games from Iron 4 to Diamond untill he reaches his main acc elo again, and make the games miserable for the people that are actually trying their best to climb in their own elo.

In my  last severeal ranked games on the enemy team there is at least one 30 lvl fresh acc, and i just want to afk in base, cus i know a bitter and hopeless stomp is incoming, cus the guy is prob stuck on his main acc in D2 and now wants to flex his skill on Silver players to feel better about his broken ego.

I dont why should i sit and play those games, and on top of that smurfing is not even a banable offense.

I dont understand why more ppl are not tilted cus od this, how are you fine logging in, serching for a game, trying your best, and suddenly enemy 12:0 fizz comes and kills your whole team, only to find out after the game that his acc is  lvl 30 and he has only 1  ranked game with fizz..

I mean i get it im a Silver scrub i play League as a casual player and i dont think i deserve to be Diamond, all i  want is  to fucking play against other silver players, is that too much to ask."
685,leagueoflegends,The whimsical jungler speculation,"The newest little legend ""bellswayer"" I believe is connected to the new champion. In the update video they said a new champion to fawn over. This is the only fawn little legend and so it makes sense that it could be a clue to the new champion. Additionally, the booms for the mid-set update said that they were going to be some that are champion related. This means that TFT accessories can be connected to champions. And if this does prove to be true then that means that the new champion will be coming from a demacian region called ""Greenfang Mountains"" as that is where the little legend originated. Also the little legend has a weird connection to bells and maybe that could mean something about the new champion using bells or sound? Again, don't take anything I say as factual. This is all speculation. If you have any thoughts on the new jungler feel free to put them in the comments. I'd love for this to turn into a discussion."
686,leagueoflegends,Here's how you fix the report system,"Here's how to you fix the report system.

""Premium Reports"" It costs XXX RP to report someone and have a real 'Human' review the game.  If your report was justified, you get your RP back.  Normal reporting still exists as it is.

I think for the most part the community would prefer a real human watching the game/viewing the game log, but that would be crazy expensive with the current system. Since tribunal went away it feels like the majority of reports are sent to an algorithm and that's that.

Q/A - 

1 - Does this mean every time I swear or end a game 0-2-0 I'll get banned?

Reporting someone and getting a refund doesn't mean that person NEEDS to be punished, similar to the current system. What actually qualifies a ban/chat restriction/etc, isn't the point of this post.

2 - What if someone is extremely rich and reports everyone they play with?

Ideally the new employees have the availability to review all games fairly, regardless of quantity of reports.  However implementing a scaling charge for reports could address that problem. (Based on the amount of reports you have open at one time)

3 - I've never spent money on League and can't afford to, would this give unfair advantages to other players?

One ""Premium report"" when your account is created could solve this problem.  If you don't report someone who doesn't deserve it, your report will be refunded after they are reviewed.  Also normal reports would still exists.

Let me know your thoughts."

689,leagueoflegends,League of Legends Strategy Game,"Recently Riot Games has began expanding their gaming arsenal,adding valorant and LOR. As a fan of strategy and war games,i find that the world of Lol,runeterra has a perfect set up for a strategic game.

I was reading about the different regions of Runeterra and found many interesting things.Such as the demacian revolution,the power struggles in Freljord/Ionia,the war-hungry and expansive noxian empire,etc.

I heavily believe that a masterpiece strategy game can be made out of this universe.Though i am not sure if its profitable for Riot to do such a thing,since strategy games don't generally reach the wide audience(maybe with the exception of total war games).But in the case they do make this happen,you got my support."

699,leagueoflegends,Season 2020 Honor 5 Chromas,
700,leagueoflegends,As a beginner why do I not play with and against other new players?,"Alright a short introduction for the beginning:

I just recently started playing League because the other moba I played before basically died. So I am not totally new to the moba genre and I like to think that I understand the basic concepts. That being said I obviously don't know all the champions and their abilities. At the moment my account is level 26 in EUW and I am still trying to find the role and champion I enjoy playing the most. 

The majority of my games I played against bots since I felt like that was the best way to learn the champions without inting my teammates. Honestly Bots are terrible though so beating them isn't really a challenge.

So in my head the next logical step was playing some normals in order to play against real people. I expected playing against other beginners who are just as bad as me though, but I am constantly getting matched with people who are way above my skill level. This makes the game not really fun to play for me and my teammates. Because of this I am also getting constantly flamed since my teammates probably don't expect a new player in their game. For example the first time I tried jungle in a normal game I was playing against an opponent jungler who was Level 219 and Platinum 2. Well you can guess how well that game went for me.

Why is it in League that new players don't play with and against equally skilled players? In no other game I ever had this kind of skill difference as a beginner with the exception of the occasional smurfs. Also since I already wrote this post what advice would you give new players in order to improve?"

I have this feeling inside me that screams for something more than laying in my bed on a Tuesday at 4pm in Fort Worth, Texas. I feel like I’m missing something in my life and as hard as I search I can’t find it. I’ve had a calling to “Go home” ever since I was 13. Even though I was born and raised in the same Texas city. I’m not sure how to explain this, but sometimes (most when I am upset or crying) the overwhelming feeling of “I just want to go home” comes into my head, even if I am at home. This even followed me to Washington where I lived for 3 years, most of the time I was married to an abusive man who shut me out from the rest of the world, which only increased this feeling. I recently arrived back in Texas to live at my mothers house, which I was hoping would soften the feeling, but it’s stronger than ever. Something inside me has always told me I’m not where i need to be. I’m not WHO I need to be. But I don’t have the answers to either riddle. Where should I go? Who should I be? 

Religion gives me no direction, I don’t know what I want to do as a career or what to study when I go back to school. I don’t know where to get a part time job. I feel completely lost in this universe, but I know I’m missing it. I feel like it’s the whole “the answer was right in front of me the whole time” thing, but I feel like I’m blind after feeling so lost for so long. 

Hopefully this makes sense to someone else who can give me a little advice/direction/personal experience. Thanks for anyone who took the time to read this, I’ve been wanting to get this out for years."

Both lived and died before the birth of Jesus Christ, and both were responsible for massive amounts of death and suffering so wtf? Why does Caesar get a pass, while Alexander has to suffer in a boiling lake of blood?

748,NoStupidQuestions,Who is this woman? She's been used in a lot of memes recently,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EYZCSiiXgAAkWR-.jpg

I swear I've seen this person before somewhere. It appears to be some sort of red carpet photo so I'd guess she's an actress? All that comes up when I reverse image search it is either memes or pictures of the kid from Two and a Half Men with a similar background, but I can't find the name of this woman. It's really bothering me!"

755,NoStupidQuestions,Why are the same civil rights attorneys repeatedly retained for high profile police abuse cases when they have previously been “unsuccessful”?,"Excuse me if I come across as ignorant on this issue. I have been reading about the horrific news regarding George Floyd, who was senselessly killed by a Minneapolis police officer over a non-violent “crime” (https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/minneapolis-police-george-floyd-fatal-arrest-officer-kneeling-neck/). 

While I was glad to see that the MPD and mayor took decisive action to fire the 4 involved officers, I was a bit perplexed that the family has retained Benjamin Crump as their attorney. While he seems to be a renowned and respected civil rights attorney, he represented multiple of the recent previous cases involving police brutality/murder/racism, including Tamir Rice, Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown. In all of these cases, the officers were found to be not guilty. I understand that the justice system is flawed and repeatedly does not favor a person of color (who in these cases aren’t even alive to speak for themselves and share their side of the story) versus a police officer. But I wonder if the litigating attorney is not getting the job done, yet he keeps being hired for these cases. Seems like insanity. Can anyone explain this?"
756,NoStupidQuestions,"If gender is a construct, why are people transgender?","First off this isn’t a hate post, I respect transgender people and think that they should be treated equally. What confuses me is the exact definition of being transgender. If gender is a construct, like the traits we assign to genders is a social construct, then wouldn’t you just be the gender that you are that does things the other gender does? Apparently transgender people feel like it’s not really their own body, but isn’t that more of a sex rather than gender thing? Again, no hate towards transgender people, just a curious cisgender person looking to learn more."
757,NoStupidQuestions,"Cops of reddit, are you ever scared that you may be partnered up with a bad cop?","Lots of videos get posted on the internet daily about bad cops abusing their power. One cop is usually doing something totally illegal to a person, and the other is just letting it happen. 

Do cops of reddit ever worry about going into work and seeing a fellow cop doing something illegally/morally wrong to a person?"

760,NoStupidQuestions,"Are large parts of the world food-eating-pest-free? If not, how was anything ever traditionally sun-dried or air-dried and cured?","I have been watching a series of youtube videos showing how this chinese woman makes food and other things completely traditionally, and often includes putting nuts, fruits, etc on wide flat trays and setting them out on the roof or other flat surfaces to dry out for days/weeks.  If I did that here (southern Ontario), I'd have a stampeding herd of squirrels, mice, and raccoons living in my neighbourhood by day 2.  However, I know that hanging things out in the sun is an ancient way of preserving food in many parts of the world; I just never thought about the details before."
761,NoStupidQuestions,"Is there a word or term for when you discover something, and then see it everywhere after that?","For example, i had never heard about the TV show Angel Beats!

762,NoStupidQuestions,Why doesn’t the US require salmonella immunizations in chickens?,"I’m gonna keep this short and hope it doesn’t trigger the automod for immunizations/vaccines even though it’s not human related. 

The UK vaccinates their chickens for salmonella. They don’t have to refrigerate their eggs like we do in the US because of it. They’ve also had a very significant decrease in salmonella cases from eggs since they began administering them in chickens in the UK. The most relevant source I could find was [this one from the same year. ](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/25/business/25vaccine.html)

They said in the article that the FDA encourages it but I don’t feel like it’s a very big matter, but it would obviously be smarter to do this with livestock. Searching didn’t really answer my question. Anyone have explanations?"

764,NoStupidQuestions,"If someone started a country under the ocean 20 miles away from america that was amazing, and millions of people started to leave what would America do?","This country says legally americans who live their dont have to pay daul taxes, and cant be extradited by america for not renouncing citizenship.

thousands of well known companies start moving towards this ever expanding country, and best of all its a voluntarist society meaning that all laws passed will have no legal punishment behind them meaning no need for a federal government, yet this has proven substantial because the top 1% have enough money to keep expanding the ocean for more land to sell.

what will America do to convince people to stay?"
765,NoStupidQuestions,Can you be born with a sexual preference?,"I’m always attracted to men who have a certain feature, and I don’t know where it comes from since no one in my family has it. However, my preference was always there. My two first crushes, when I was like 6 years old or so, both had that feature. And whenever I’d see it on a guy I was like wow this type of guys look so much better than the others. I didn’t know why I was thinking that way, but I was. When I was 11 I remember being hugged by a friendly sports teacher (istg nothing weird or inappropriate, he knew my family we were platonically close) who also had that feature and I couldn’t exactly be aroused but it was something close to it.

So is it just written in my genetic code or something? Is it because my first crush had that feature? Did you have a similar experience?"
766,NoStupidQuestions,Why do I get called a bootlicker for respecting good police officers?,"Many times on reddit I've come across posts where people are just non-stop hating on police. I will chime in and say that this cop in particular is a piece of shit, but not all cops are like this. People will immediately downvote me and call me a bootlicker and spout hate about why all cops are pigs. Why? I've never ONCE come across an officer in my life, in person, who has abused their power or been rude or disrespectful to me. I respect them and I am thankful for when they do their job and protect me, and all the other law abiding citizens. Why do cop-haters have a hate for ALL cops? Why not just the BAD ones?"

He won’t let me take him to the emergency room because he’s scared of how much it’ll cost. We can’t afford health insurance for either of us. His regular back doctor is only seeing one fucking patient per day and the soonest you can schedule an appointment is late July.

My dad already has several slipped disks, and a week ago he pulled a muscle in his back. A couple days ago he hurt it much more severely. To be honest I think he has a torn muscle. He is in so much pain that he is constantly on the verge of crying. He is a grown man with a tough guy persona, to give perspective."

I guess I just never thought about it, but anyway, I was wondering if any of you can shine a light on that and maybe give some links to interviews with psychopaths that show this behavior?

Do you see a future for non-horror found footage films?"
1028,movies,'Swallow' (2019) handled a tricky moment so well,"Massive spoiler. 

&#x200B;

Coming to the final moments of Swallow, when Hunter finally gets to confront her rapist father, I was nervous to my core when she asked him why he did what he did. This moment, both for the character and the viewer, could have gone in so many awful ways. I could not imagine there being a satisfactory answer to this question. His response - and general lack of a reason - was handled so well by the script because it would be dangerous to try to give a grounded explanation for rape outside of the abuse of power, being mainly what he really admitted to. It would have been even more difficult to imagine an answer that would have made Hunter feel any understanding. That scene was so moving and so well done in terms of dialogue and acting. 

&#x200B;

I appreciate it when care is taken for how dialogue could be interpreted by viewers who might be dealing with the same questions, and how harmful it could have been if done wrong. Swallow is a disturbing and enthralling film, and one of the best-looking I've seen recently. It juggles all of its ideas quite neatly. 

&#x200B;

I'd be interested to see if any other films have had a rapist try to explain their actions, because I don't seem to recall such a direct and personal approach to this question before."

1035,movies,"I miss ""level up"" action movies that actually pay off","Growing up, my favorite movies were of the Jackie Chan variety. As a kid, I honestly couldn't have told you exactly *why*, just that they were funny but satisfying. It took to watching this [Every Frame a Painting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1PCtIaM_GQ) video to really understand what it was that I enjoyed about those Jackie movies that I find missing in many of today's action films. 

I dub it the ""level up"". When the hero has to level up and learn new tricks or ways to beat the villain *after* being beaten down repeatedly throughout the movie. Jackie was a master at this, routinely getting his ass kicked before coming out on top at the end. Typically this happened through a long, drawn out fight which felt like a real payoff after all the shit he takes throughout the film. 

Thinking on the MCU, I felt like only a few of the films actually followed this type of set-up. While I get that this sentiment won't be there for everyone, I LOVE seeing a big payoff/fight at the end of the movie. In Iron Man we see the awesome level up happening in the way of suits but the final fight is really lackluster. It's short and quick. It almost didn't feel deserved. Tony went through the hero's journey but the final fight just felt really lackluster. Iron Man 2 felt even shorter. 

Alternatively, The Incredible Hulk felt like a serious pay-off because, although the roles were swapped, there was a consistent build up to the big fight. The Abomination gets bested two times (before he becomes the Abomination) and the final showdown has some real weight to it. It's drawn out, new moves are used and the final submission of the Abomination felt worth the entire buildup. 

I would love to see more of this in action cinema today rather than the action/fighting just taking a backseat to the story."
1036,movies,Studio Ghibli films are streaming on HBO Max. Here’s what you should watch first.,
1037,movies,A Fistful of Dollars (1964) The creation of an iconic anti-hero.,"
When it comes remakes Sergio Leone's *A Fistful of Dollars* is a perfect example of how to do it right. There's no point in doing a carbon copy of the original and in the case of *A Fistful of Dollars* Leone and company took the basic plot of Akira Kurosawa's *Yojimbo* and then did a complete cultural shift by transplanting the Samurai tale into the Old West. It's pretty much genius.

It was *A Fistful of Dollars* that basically kicked started the modern action hero with Clint Eastwood playing a far from squeaky clean hero that had been the standard Hollywood stock type for decades, with the likes of Gary Cooper or Jimmy Stewart winning the fare hand of Grace Kelly, instead, Leone gives us an anti-hero who is a violent enigma with a moral code that isn't quite readable, with him killing for money which is not a typical hero motivation, and Eastwood was brilliant as this taciturn man of action. This film also introduced the world to Sergio Leone's trademark extreme close-up which was wonderfully combined with Ennio Morricone's amazing score.

It's hard to imagine a world without this iconic character that Leone and Eastwood created and even more surprising that it happened at all considering Eastwood was mostly known as the squeaky clean Rowdy Yates from the television series *Rawhide*, a character far from the poncho wearing Man With No Name.

Note to future filmmakers, get permission first before going ahead with your remake. Kurosawa sued the filmmakers for breach of copyright and won 15% of the worldwide distribution. Apparently Kurosawa made more money off of this movie than he did on *Yojimbo*."
1038,movies,Is Adam Sandler a Oscar nominee worthy actor?,"I really think he is. I know many people think his movies are bad and they wouldn’t be wrong but Adam is a really capable actor when he’s given the right material. The problem with Adam is that he’s practically the same character in all of the movie he makes with his own company, Happy Madison Productions. So he’s basically made himself into a typecast actor. But in almost all of the films where Adam doesn’t purposely try to be the same characters he’s absolutely killed it. And I think he deserved an Oscar nod for his performance in Uncut Gems. Adam is a tremendous actor despite what critics say, it’s just time for him to realize it."
1039,movies,Used Cars (1980) is a perfect film,"Many years ago when I was in film school, one of my favorite professors (he taught screenwriting) told me that his favorite film is **Used Cars**. I had not seen it, but thought that was kind of a weird film to be your favorite. I looked it up and it seems like any other 80s slapstick comedy.

This past weekend I decided to finally give it a shot to see what he was talking about. So I watched it, and I really enjoyed it! It was super funny and well made, some of the humor was pretty dark and Kurt Russell was the perfect choice for the role of a scummy yet likable used car salesman.

But, as someone who appreciates movies that keep the runtime around 90 mins, I felt my only complaint was that it was a bit too long, at about 2 hours, which for a comedy might be more than necessary. So I decided to watch it again, and look for scenes that didn't need to be in the film.

As it turns out, dear reader, there is not one single **second** of Used Cars that doesn't move the plot forward in some way. Even the little things, like one of the salesman being overly superstitious, come back to serve the plot in some big way. Honestly it blows my mind to think about. You always read about the script for **Chinatown**, and how it's the most perfect script ever written, but I humbly submit Robert Zemeckis' 1980 screwball farce to be included in that discussion.

If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it!

1040,movies,UTØYA - JULY 22 and United 93 are a couple of the most crushing and anxiety inducing movies I have seen,"UTØYA - JULY 22 has seemingly not been posted about here, but holy shit I couldnt catch my breath. It's a story about the Utoya attack in 2011 which saw 77 kids in Norway killed. ""22 July"" is another good movie about the attack which focuses more on the aftermath, while ""UTØYA - JULY 22"" focuses on the attack itself, it is a minute by minute story about a girl trying to survive. This isnt on any US streaming services, I lucked into finding the DVD at a shop. 


United 93 is a movie on US Netflix that tells the story of one of the 9/11 planes. This focuses not only on the events inside the plane, but the government and flight traffic controllers trying to figure out what is going on. The first half was a bit boring but it was absolutely necessary buildup to an insane second half. The second half had me nearly trembling from the anxiety. An incredible and tragic movie."

He's handled everything from slapstick  comedy to drama to musicals to comic adaptations with real dedication to  his characters. I feel like he's often been overlooked for casting  despite taking his roles seriously even when they aren't the best parts. I'm not surprised that he escapes into his parts given what his life of acting got him away from regarding his childhood, but from everything I've seen he really does show gratitude for what he has and what he's accomplished even if it hasn't always led to much in the way of acclaim.

Who else should have perhaps gotten more fanfare or a better shot at more projects?"

Each raging step is beautifully captured; the speed of her approach evidenced in every piece of flung debris as she claws her way forward!<.

1061,movies,What movies absolutely wouldn't have gotten the green light if the genders of the essential characters were swapped?,"This came to mind after seeing a few titles come up around this quite a few times in different threads and in discussions over the years. I have an idea of some that will come up, but I'm sure there are others that won't pop into my head. To me the absolute worst is Adam Sandler's *That's My Boy*. There is zero chance anyone even dares to pitch a film about a studly 20-something male teacher knocking up a 13 year old girl after coercing *at best* as a comedy, let alone manages to get it produced as a major picture release. It's fine for a young boy to be a badass for being raped by a woman in a situation he couldn't possibly understand as he's portrayed in the film apparently, but I can't see any situation in which that script sees the light of day if the teacher were a man, or even more so, if the teacher and student had been of the same gender.

1069,movies,Marrowbone Discussion- Major Spoilers,"Major Spoilers for the WHOLE FILM Follow! 

When their father was trying to entice Jack into the attic do you think Sam, Jane, and Billy were already dead? I kind of have this weird feeling that they were still alive when Jack bricked up the attic. 

For one, at one point Jane/Jack says, ""the screams were endless"". Why would he say, ""the screams"" and not, ""his screams""? Also at one point right after the father is locked in the attic Jack can hear his siblings screaming, and to clear his head he breaks the mirror. Were the screams in his mind, or real? Another reason why I think they might have been alive for a week, like Jane/Jack said they were, is because the dad used Tom as bait. He could of left the attic after he stabbed Tom, but he chose to hide, and see if someone would come for him. He could have used the younger siblings as bait, and then when he realized Jack wasn't coming he killed them. 

I think Jack honestly thought they were dead, bricked up the attic, and then realized that they weren't. He couldn't face that fact/his father again so instead of tearing down the wall, he tried to kill himself. 

What do you think?"

Cast aside you also have Leone taking his first cinematic trip to Monument Valley - home of all the John Ford Westerns - making this the first Spaghetti Western to be filmed outside of Spain, and it is all wonderfully shot by Tonino Delli Colli, Leone's director of photography. Then we have the fantastic score by legendary composer Ennio Morricone as if we needed more reasons to love this film more.

This is easily one of the greatest westerns ever put to screen and I never get tired of watching it.  If you haven't seen this film do your best to rectify the situation."

1089,movies,Thoughts on the Lady from Shanghai (1947),"To give youse a list of what else of Welles I’ve seen: Citizen Kane, The Stranger, The Other Side of the Wind, The Lady from Shanghai, and The Immortal Story. Kane is obviously a masterpiece and I found The Stranger and The Other Side is the Wind to be excellent films. However found The Immortal Story to be a pretentious bore and The Lady from Shanghai to be a massive letdown when I watched it a few years ago, despite seeing it had gotten good reviews.

Yesterday I decided to give Shanghai another chance and my thoughts haven’t changed much. To start with a point many state, the plot is messy and and doesn’t make much sense. When it is finally revealed at the end, it’s from Welles rambling about in his narration in his awful Irish accent which at that point I no longer cared. Welles and Hayworth don’t have chemistry either, but then again their marriage ended soon after filming. 

Most of the acting is downright awful especially from Glenn Anders who played George Grisby, the guy who pays Welles’ character to “murder” him. Some of the dialogue exchanges are horrendous, especially in the scene where Grisby lays out his plan to fake his death, after having just explained the whole thing, reasoning and all, Welles’ character asks him why, and Grisby explains basically the same thing again. I found Hayworth’s acting to be generally mediocre. A lot of the dialogue often rambled especially when Welles and Hayworth talk or when Welles gives some sort of anecdote to the other characters.

On the positive side, the courtroom antics (though nothing amazing) are a nice distraction and change to a faster pace from the rambling mess of the first half of the film, and the shootout in the hall of mirrors is easily the high point of the film and a great setpiece. 

So what do youse think of the film? Overall I believe it was a film that had potential but wasted it all and the final sequence is the only thing keeping me from completely disliking it. If you do like it, what are you’re thoughts, and what do you think I’m missing. Why do you believe it has gotten praise?"

Similarly, the colder you go in, the better, so if at any point reading through this post you're sold on it, stop reading and go watch it.

The film was Sydney Lumet's (12 Angry Men) last directorial feature before his death. It's [*Certified Fresh* on Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/before_the_devil_knows_youre_dead) and is [a *Must See* on Metacritic
](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/before-the-devil-knows-youre-dead)

Lumet aside, this is a film that is easy to recommend on the cast alone. It's more or less an r/movies dream team:

Philip Seymour Hoffman

Ethan Hawke 

Marisa Tomei

Michael Shannon

Amy Ryan

Albert Finney

The setup is about two brothers who partner up on a robbery so that they can get themselves out of debt. The story itself shares a lot of similar themes to Uncut Gems, which makes it easy to recommend one if you like the other. Time-worn motifs like sibling rivalry, addiction, financial struggle, and of course family dysfunction.

The telling of the story is also experimental with how the chronology is layered which plays a huge role in how it's able to build and maintain tension.

The perfect AI is a perfect representation or embodiment of a real-life human that has been born of a human, lived, died like the rest of us, and everything in between. Apart from the being born and dying part, since until AI figures out a way to reproduce and has a lifespan like us, they're not really humans lol. What separates us from AI is birth and death. 

We as humans don't have the power or capacity to kill our creator in the literal sense. Whether you believe in one or not. If you believe in one, you don't get to kill the creator. If you don't,  you don't get to kill the origin and evolution. 

In the film, when Nathan, Ava's creator says that she is complete, finished, has passed the final test, what does she go out and do? Her very human survival instincts are shown.

1201,teenagers,[Mod] r/teenagers 2020 Census Results,"Hello /r/teenagers! 

Firstly, thank you to everyone who participated in /r/teenagers' second annual census! After collecting data from almost 4000 users (3,742) over the course of the last three weeks, the mod team has put together the most up-to-date representation of the demographics of our subreddit! The data we gathered from this census will help us improve our moderation to best reflect the community's interests going forwards. In this post, we will be showing you some of the highlights of our findings. A more complete dataset can be found in the links below. 


#General Information

*This section is a compilation of the most interesting data collected from our questions regarding the basics of /r/teenagers demographics*

First, let's start with age! Assuming everyone who selected the 20+ option is exactly 20 years old, the average user of r/teenagers is 15.13 years old. 780 out of the 3,742 users who answered our census claimed to be 15, making it the most popular age as well as the average. 14 was just short of being the most common age, with only one less respondent. totaling up to 779, reporting being 14. Those 18 and over made up less than 10% of the subreddit's users, with the options for 18, 19, and 20+ only accounting for 9.8% of the data collected. 

The demographic of gender on /r/teenagers was dominated by males, who accounted for 76.7% of the responses. Females still accounted for 20.1%, showing us they do exist, even if they aren't as common as guys.  

The diversity and acceptance of the /r/teenagers community was put on display by our statistic regarding sexual orientation, with over 26.9% of respondents reporting being members of the LGBTQ+ community, encompassing our homosexual, bisexual/pansexual, and asexual users! A 2017 Gallup poll which analyzed data of the United States found that about 4.5% of adults belonged to the LGBTQ+ community, meaning the /r/teenagers community has more than 5 times the representation of LGBTQ+ members than the United States! 

While a large majority, totaling 68.5%, of /r/teenagers users live in America, the community is one that stretches worldwide. While the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia made up the following top spots on the list, respondents from our census reported using /r/teenagers from countries like Brazil (13 response), Kenya (1 response), and Vietnam (3 responses). That means /r/teenagers has been accessed from every continent in the world, apart from Antarctica. 

#Miscellaneous Information

*This year's census was the first to contain some more fun, personality-based questions to help us better know what our users are like! We asked users about their hobbies, interests, and future plans. Here are some of the most interesting things we found!*

By far, discord is the most commonly used social media platform by /r/teenagers members, with 70.8% of respondents using it. Apparently, Instagram isn't as bad as some say it is, with it being the second most used platform with 60.1% of respondents using it. The same applies for TikTok, as 27.8% of respondents reported using the platform. Pew Research Center found that 69% of American adults use Facebook. Compared to the 14.6% of our respondents who reported using the platform. /r/teenagers users are significantly less likely to use Facebook than the average American. 

When asked ""Which of the following music genres best describes your taste?"" a plurality, totaling 22.4% of users, reported rock being their favorite. Hip Hop/Rap, which was second in our census report, is the most popular genre of music in the United States as per a Nielsen Music report from 2017. Other notable statistics from the rankings were pop accumulating 13.2% of responses, metal accumulating 4.8%, and classical accumulating 3.9%. 

When asked to describe their political opinions, almost half of respondents, totaling 45.6%, reported falling into the ""liberal or left-leaning"" category. 19.7% of users reported being more ""conservative or right-leaning"" while 21.1% reported being apolitical. 

As teenagers, most of us are already looking forward to our future education. 67.7% of respondents reported planning on finishing at least 4 years of education. Compared to current data from the United States Census Bureau, only 33.4% of Americans over the age of 25 report having a bachelor's degree. 



#Community Feedback

All of the following statements were evaluated on a scale from 1 to 5, with 5 indicating that the respondent strongly agreed.*



When asked if users ""enjoy being a part of r/teenagers."", the average score came out to 4.04, indicating a majority of our users are happy to be members of the community. The same score of 4.04 was also the average response to the statement ""I feel safe posting/commenting on r/teenagers."" As moderators, we want nothing more to make our users feel safe and comfortable using our subreddit, so we are glad we are doing something right! 

Most users strongly agreed that memes were an important part of /r/teenagers with an average of 4.37 on our 1 to 5 scale. The same was true for our text-post weekend policy, with the average rating of the statement ""I like self-post weekends."" being 3.67

When asked to evaluate the claim ""I feel that the moderators have been helpful when I had a question/issue."" the average rating came out to 3.56, which while showing most agreed is too low for our standards.

However, as per the guidance of the World Health Organization, we must not let fear set in and take hold of our community, filling people with fear and filling our feeds with crappy reposts about how we are responding to the virus.  ""Corona panic"" is a condition which can do irreparable harm to any community (even one as crappy as this one).  

To attempt to contain the effects, any individual who tests positive for Corona panic will receive a 14 day quarantine for the safety of not just the community, but for themselves as well.

1412,AskMen,How are you supposed to react to a girl sending you revealing pictures of herself?,"A girl I'm friends with has been sending me revealing pictures of her for a week now. She always tells me that it's kinda embarrassing because, well, they're provocative, but I don't mind.

She has told me that she trusts me and that's why she sends the pics, but sometimes she sends one and says ""Don't I look like a snack?"" What am I supposed to say here? ""Yes, girl. You're thicker than a bowl of oatmeal""?

Sometimes I tell her that yes she looks pretty in those pictures and that her pose really makes her best attributes shine. However, I don't wanna over step my boundaries with her. 

She's also seeing a guy from time to time, and sometimes she uploads pics with him saying that he makes him very happy. I have asked her why she doesn't send him those pics and she told me it's not the same kind of trust, so that's why she sends them to me.

I don't mind seeing the pics, nor I use them for my ""personal gain"", but I really don't know how to talk to her when she sends them."

I am all for making out and having fun together but I don’t like to rush into anything sexual. How do you do that without crushing a guys self esteem? And when? In the middle of a make out session on his couch or way before you ever go over?
1418,AskMen,How have you guys gained self-confidence?,"I'm sorely lacking in self-confidence, and have for as long as I can remember. I know that I'm capable of doing things, but when it actually comes down to it, I just feel inadequate.

Particularly when it comes to girls. I have never felt like I'm worthy of anyone liking me in a romantic way, and it really shows.

I really need some advice as to how to gain some confidence, but I also don't want to be one of those people with a massive ego. Whenever I start to have some confidence in myself, I always feel like I'm being an asshole, and I lose all my confidence because I start second guessing myself."
1419,AskMen,How the hell do you dress well?,"Usually what I wear is just black and I recently got a white gilet which I wear (since its really warm in England rn). I’m 16 and I’m not on about dressing fancy because I’m not often wearing a suit. My “go-to” is often some black joggers that I have (SikSilk) with a black top, trainer socks, Nike 270s (since they’re my favourite) and a black top. But I feel like I should be trying to add more colour, I’m just not sure how to.

Edit: Thank you all so much for the replies and advice, but I won’t be able to reply to every single one since there’s so many. Thank you once again:)"
1420,AskMen,"Men who never thought they would fall in love / build a relationship etc, how did it happen and what advice do you have?","I’m 24, I’ve been out on dates with more girls than I’d like to admit considering that most of them haven’t wanted to see me again. Losing hope especially with all the COVID shit going on. I’ve always wanted a relationship but I wasn’t ever able to make it happen and kinda just started fucking around as a result which has hurt me in the long run.

1421,AskMen,"Fellow men, I need some motivation, how do I get my sh*t back on track?","I'm a 33 year old guy. I've got a decent job, little apartment with a roommate who mostly keeps to himself. A cat that wont drink out of the $50 water fountain I bought for her because she likes to stick her head in my water cups.

Anyway, onto the real stuff. Im overweight, 330 lbs currently. Oddly enough, I did keto for a year and half and lost over 85 pounds. So my current weight is the lowest I've been in over a decade. But it's still not enough. For many reasons, I dropped off my diet and fell back into some of my old habits. Overeating from boredom and depression as well as not being active at all. When I was on my diet, I would go to the gym 3 times a week for cardio. Now I have trouble getting up my stairs without running out of breath.

I want to go back to the gym, but due to current situations, all gyms are closed. I feel like that was the biggest factor for me on my weight loss. Going to the gym was the single most important thing for me mentally because I earned my exhaustion and it wasn't a side effect of my laziness. I slept better, I felt better mentally and physically, I was motivated too.but for some reason I have mental block that is preventing me from even starting back up again.

With gyms closed, what can I do for cardio? I must mention that I have mild asthma too, so going outside for a jog is out of the question here. I have very humid air filled with pollen and that a recipe for disaster when paired with outside activities. I have stairs, but I'm already worried about the impact on my knees from just daily walking up and down. I tore a calf muscle going up these stairs when I was at my heaviest weight years ago. 

Also, any motivational words or wisdom are highly encouraged. Thanks gents."

1432,AskMen,How did you find the motivation to go to the gym after some years of being lazy?,"So, I stopped going to the gym a few years ago, at the beggining I simply didn't had enough time and after a while I just got used with being lazy. I lost some body mass and I am too skinny now. A friend showed me a photo of us back in the day at a pool party and it hit me like a brick. 

Right now all I can think about is for the gyms to open so I can get back in there, I'm gonna start working out in the mornings too, like I used to. But my question is, did you had a period like this? How did you get over it?

And for the bros who are still working out, please don't stop, whatever you do, just keep going and whatever sport you practice keep doing it."

1435,AskMen,"What's the most awkward situation you've had where someone likes you, you dont like them and they wont leave you alone?","Theres this one old guy when I was working that I would see from time to time, and he happened to be gay. He would asked me the creepiest questions and it really felt uncomfortable.

He would be like ""You got a lot of whiskers there. You got a lot of chest hair?""

And I would be like ""Uh....yeah?"" And then he was like ""So, you gotta girlfriend?"". And I was like ""Uh....no?"". And he would just ask me all these creepy questions 

A few weeks ago (I havent been working there since march), I walked to the local gas station and saw him there. Since I'm nice I chatted with him for a minute. Then went inside. I came back out and he was still there. 

Then he was outside filling his gas still and he asked me if I lived around there. I said ""uh...yeah"" and asked me if I needed a ride. I declined.

Then he asked me 4 more times and said thinks like ""oh I wont bite!"" And ""oh come on"". But I stood my ground and left 

Well today I walked to the gas station again and wouldnt you know it! Hes there again. And he didnt see me but I did everything I could so he didnt. It was so awkward and I've never had to do that before. Thought he might kidnap me"

I never know what to say when they joke about how old they are. Like “You never know with us old people, we might need  an ambulance at any minute!” Or they joke about how hard it is to get up and down stairs or whatever. I sometimes feel like the correct response is to assure them you’re not that old but I never know what to say.

Edit: I forgot to say some of the people are newly retired. So actually not old at all."
1446,AskMen,What should a first time drinker get?,"Want to buy a bottle of alcohol. Never had alcohol once but quarantine made me bored I guess.

1450,AskMen,How do you speak your mind?,"Normally I wouldn’t have a problem when it comes to this but lately I’ve been feeling frustrated and unheard in regards to a few family members.

Most of the time I don’t care what I’ll say and I would just say whatever came to my mind with no thought or reasoning behind it. I’ve always been that way, it would get people angry, laughing, etc. I used to have no filter. I don’t know if it’s because i’ve grown older or if it’s a lack of confidence but I often find myself biting my tongue on certain things. 

Sometimes my uncle, who lives with us, gets me frustrated and angry with the way he acts and disregards the boundaries I set with him. My mother doesn’t listen to anything I have to say anymore, it just goes in one ear and out the other. 

Maybe subconsciously I know if I say what I want it’ll get me nowhere and I just don’t speak but I don’t like it, I want to be able to say what I want. How have you dealt with this?"
1451,AskMen,How do I cut off a toxic family member without moving out?,"Basically my sister has serious temperament issues. Shes the kind of person who just broods  toxic ideas and mean comments in her own head all day. She'll be buddy buddy with me one moment and as soon as something goes even slightly not her way she'll snap and say whatever she thinks will hurt you the most. 0-100 toxicity in an instant.

It's my opinion that in order to truly become immune to someone's opinion/comments you have to cut off the positive moments in order to shield yourself from the negative. Unfortunately it's not as simple and just cutting them off as we both live at home and I'm not in a position to move out. Have any of you been in a similar situation? What did you do/would you advise I do so that she no longer affects me when she inevitably flips?"
1452,AskMen,How to approach fetishes?,So I’ve never been openly sexual about anything because it’s been a taboo in my family. I got divorced a few years ago and now I’m ready to open myself up. I’ve started dating again and in the process discovered what turns me on. I see girls who cater to men’s fetishes and honestly I find it to be a turn on. They are confident and sexy and I love the dynamic these women have with the men. How can I get into this? I want to sell pics and videos but I want to tailor it to what each person wants and craves. Anyone have any suggestions for starting something like this? I’m ready to delve into my sexuality!!

Genetic engineering has advanced to the point that any animal can be scaled up or scaled down to the size of a horse and innate behavior can be changed enough to allow for domestication. What animal will you choose as your companion that you ride around on for fun?,"I think my top 3 would be a tiger, a crab, or a kangaroo

Both the tiger and crab would look pretty badass. Can you imagine what a horse sized crab would look like? Fucking menacing. I'm not sure which would be faster, but no one would want to mess with you if you were riding around on either of them.

Obviously with the kangaroo I would sit in the pouch and it would hop me around. Although, admittedly, it would probably be hard to control where you want the kangaroo to go from the pouch position."
1457,AskMen,Where are places I can go to meet women and make friends in general?,"I’m 19 and ever since I graduated high school, I find it hard to meet people outside of work.

1460,AskMen,How do you think your behaviour differs when you’re dating someone for sex vs. Potentially a relationship?,"I see a lot of people post about guys sending a ‘you up?’ Text at 2am, but in my experience that rarely happens. The worst scenario, which I encounter a lot, is where the guy tries to make me feel like he wants a relationship by spending loads of time with me, texting me all the time etc... only to find out he only wanted sex. Why? It makes it hard to know when they just want something casual (which I’d be down for, if they were right), but I don’t like feeling ‘tricked’ almost. 

What are some signs you show when you are considering your date as something more serious? After how many dates do you start to realise you might take it further?"
1461,AskMen,What are the things you wish you could do without having to worry whether it would come across as masculine?,"I'm a bi guy, and obviously in the queer community we are less bound by expectations of what men should be like to be considered valid, and I have found it easier to just be myself when I am with other members of the queer community.   


I therefore have little idea of what it is like for straight guys because I do not really have close friendships with them.

&nbsp;

I think about this even more after I watch a documentary or show where someone is doing something meaningful. For example, I watched ""The Last Dance"" (Michael Jordan doc), and I couldn't help but think the whole time that I suck and it's too late to accomplish anything great and trying to do anything but work and sleep is pointless.

Since then I’ve been self conscious about everything about myself, and when I have sex now I don’t feel comfortable in my own skin. Partners I’ve been with haven’t ever mentioned not having a good time, but I’m paranoid that they’re all secretly thinking the same way and I’ve stopped having sex altogether lately bc if it. I work out decently often, eat well, and am in general good shape, but I feel like a I’m whale with a baby carrot for a dick. Besides exercise, how does one feel better about their body?"

1482,AskMen,What to do when my girlfriend is upset half the week?,"I’d like to start off by saying that I have had a few relationships with different women, and it seems that this is a common theme: once we get comfortable with eachother, the real her starts coming out, the part where every other day seems like PMS week, and every thing I do is wrong for some twisted reason. 
In this case, we have been dating since late 2019, and once quarantine hot we decided to bunk up together. Of course this was a big leap, but it’s been nice being able to fall in love together while living together in quarantine. 
However, it has started to seem the past month or so that she just has those days where every single thing I do pisses her off. Anything I do, black or white, up or down, she responds with a snappy comment, throws her hands up in anger, storms off, etc.
We took a socially distanced camping trip this weekend, and today every single thing I said or did was met with her frustration and anger. We had a long conversation about it, as we often do, where I expressed that I do NOT want to allow this to become the norm. I know that many of my previous relationships have also evolved into this walking-on-eggshells shitshow where everything is either wrong or wrong. 
I am generally seen as a happy go lucky guy, and I honestly don’t want anything more than just a good day, without anger or frustration. Is that too much to ask? 
Can someone tell me if this is just a normal trait of relationships—that it is just normal for them to get furious about the most negligible things, and allow that to ruin an entire day— or have I just found myself in an unlucky situation once more?"
1483,AskMen,Women have a thousand different words you can use to compliment their physical appearance but what words do men have?," Besides handsome, or dashing if you want to be cheeky, I can’t think of any other physical compliments exclusively for men/boyfriends. Sure, you have words like sexy but so do women. Women have adorable, cute, beautiful, pretty, gorgeous, stunning, what the hell do you call a guy besides handsome and hitting them with the old-school “dashing” and “schnazy”?

Disclaimer: I know I can call my boyfriend cute and pretty but he doesn’t really like it at all so I’m trying to find compliments he’ll actually accept without his somewhat fragile masculinity being harmed in the process. 

“Pretty” is my best compliment for guys. I love pretty guys, they are DEFINITELY my type but he hates it and doesn’t take it seriously. He’d rather be manly or masculine instead of pretty. It’s a bummer, I know, and something we gotta work on but I need help with replacements in the meantime"

1491,AskMen,How to over come insecurity about people talking behind my back?,"I used to be bullied in high school. I've always had poor self-esteem. But ever since I joined college I turned things around. I started working out and took a lot of effort to improve my appearance.I'm a junior in college now. I'm by no means really handsome but for the past couple of years my looks have improved immensely after gaining weight and taking better care of my self.

My confidence has definitely improved. I gathered the courage to ask one of the hottest girl in college out on a date. And somehow it worked. We've been together for a couple of months now and things are going great. I've never been happier in my life.

A few days ago my GF posted a picture on Instagram and as usual people were complementing her. I recognized one of guys who commented. He used to go to my high school lets call him ""David"". I've talked to him before(when I was in school) and we've been in good terms but I always felt that he looked down on me like most people did back in high school.

I'm not proud of the man I was and wan't to get over it but I'm still not at a point where I can put everything behind me, I'm still insecure. My GF is really beautiful she's so confident and has always been popular. Guys used to talk about her all the time (like it's high school) and a lot of guys were interested in her. Needless to say despite being way more confident than before I still feel like she is out of my league.

I don't talk about my miserable high school life with my GF. I will open up eventually but definitely not now. I always behave in a cool and confident manner when I'm around my girlfriend. She finds me attractive and reliable. That's kind of man I want to be for the rest of my life.

Now I think ""David"" is in the same department as my GF but a year lower so they are in talking terms. Cause of this I've been anxious and insecure for the past few days. I've seen a lot of guys talk trash about someone when they get a hot GF. I just don't wan't David to tell her that I'm a wimp and I used to be a loser in high school. I don't want him to talk trash behind my back .Maybe I'm just being paranoid as the roots of my insecurities are quiet deep.

If in case it does happens I won't know how to react and I don't know how my GF will react. She'll probably be supportive but it's a really sensitive subject for me. As I said before I will eventually open up, but I wan't it to be on my terms. I don't want her to hear about it from someone else especially if they intend to talk me down out of jealousy.

So tell me guys, would other men talk shit about be behind my back or am I just over reacting. And how should I react if they do talk me down?"

# Stimulus checks (Updated on May 20th)

## IRS adds phone operators

[The IRS has announced they are hiring 3,500 telephone representatives to answer some of the most common questions about Economic Impact Payments.](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-adds-phone-operators-to-answer-economic-impact-payment-questions)

**The number to call is 800-919-9835.**

## Checking payment status

It may take a long time to get through to someone due to a high volume of calls.

The IRS also has a portal where non-filers can enter their payment information to get a stimulus check, for filers to check payment status, confirm their payment type, and enter direct deposit information:

**https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payments**

**Note that the IRS is only updating payments status once per day. Don't wreck yourself checking every five minutes.**

## Overview

The CARES Act authorizing relief/stimulus payments directly to individuals has been passed into law.

For non-dependent individuals, you are entitled to $1,200 if your AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) is below $75,000. For married couples filing jointly, it is $2,400 if your joint AGI is below $150,000. Taxpayers with dependent qualifying children will receive $500 per qualifying child (16 or younger, the rules are based on the child tax credit).

If your AGI is above the income threshold of $75,000 or $150,000, you will be entitled $5 less for every additional $100 of income above that threshold until the amount is fully phased out. For example, if you are single and without kids, the potential maximum amount of $1,200 is completely phased out once your income hits $99,000. If you are married with two young children then the maximum payment of $3,400 is completely phased out once your joint income hits $218,000.

Prior years' tax returns are being used to calculate each person's stimulus payment. If you filed your 2019 tax return already, that will be used. If not, then your 2018 tax return will be used. If you have not filed taxes for 2018 or 2019, you should do so as soon as possible to secure your eligibility for a prompt payment. Finally, if your 2020 income and status would allow you to receive you a larger payment, you will have to wait until you file in 2021 for the 2020 tax year, and you will receive the difference as a credit on your 2020 tax return.

Basically, you will get to keep the payment you receive and if you receive a smaller payment than your 2020 income would allow, you'll get a credit when you file your 2020 taxes.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How will I get paid?**

If you received your tax refund by direct deposit into a single bank account, your relief payment will be deposited to the same account. If you did not receive your refund by direct deposit, or if it was deposited to more than one account, a physical check will be mailed to you at the address on your tax return. If you have not filed taxes, it is likely that the IRS will attempt to get your address from other agencies, like the Social Security Administration or the Department of Veteran's Affairs.

**What if I am a dependent?**

Feels bad, man.

It's worth noting that eligibility is based on your dependency status for 2020, so if you were claimed as a dependent in 2019 and can't be claimed as a dependent in 2020, you should get the $1,200 (or the lower amount if your income is high), just not until they file their 2020 return.

Finally, it's important to know that dependency status is not elective. You are either a dependent or you are not a dependent according to IRS rules.

**Is this just an ""advance"" on my tax refund?**

No. Assuming you're eligible, the money is a credit and not an advance on money you would have been owed already.

**What if I am sent an amount that is higher than my 2020 income would allow?**

There were some initial reports that the excess would come out of your future tax refund, but the consensus seems to be that you get to keep the money.

According to [this article from CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/politics/stimulus-payments/index.html):

> And those who make more this year than last would not have to pay back any stimulus money they receive if they end up exceeding the thresholds. The payments would not be subject to tax, and those who owe back taxes would still get a check.

The [Washington Post has a similar statement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/coronavirus-stimulus-check-calculator/).

**The IRS does not have my direct deposit information. What can I do?**

> [In the coming weeks, [the US] Treasury plans to develop a web-based portal for individuals to provide their banking information to the IRS online, so that individuals can receive payments immediately as opposed to checks in the mail.](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payments-what-you-need-to-know)

# If you lose your job or are at risk of losing your job

Please read the **[Job Loss Megathread: unemployment resources, state-specific information, and help](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fkyu8h/job_loss_megathread_unemployment_resources/)**.

**If you have any questions regarding those resources, feel free to ask here, but please be as specific as possible with your current situation and what steps you have taken so far.**

# Stock market turbulence

It's very natural to be feel concerned when there's a large drop in the stock market, especially after such a long period of growth, but it's important to keep perspective and avoid making rash decisions.

First, take a deep breath. Market downturns are not uncommon or unusual. [Between 1980 and 2017, there were **11 market corrections and 8 bear markets**.](https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article/NewsPerspectiveMktDownturns)

[Trying to time the market rarely turns out well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unFn-ddtqiM&t=4) and most people trying to enter or exit the market based on emotion, gut feelings, and everyone's predictions end up doing far worse than if they had simply continued business as normal. **[Stick to your plan and stay the course.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2jbtyu/investment_pro_tip_stay_the_course/)**

To quote Warren Buffett: **[""to buy or sell on current news is just crazy""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaXmmaEs-hU&t=24)**.

Don't make an emotional decision, don't try to predict where the market is headed in the short run, and make decisions for the long run. You're investing for decades, not trying to predict the Dow Jones or S&P 500 next week, next month, or even next year.

# Being financially prepared and practicing sound finances

1. [Budget your money and reduce expenses.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_0.3A_budget_and_reduce_expenses.2C_set_realistic_goals) Fundamental to a sound financial footing is knowing where your money is going. Budgeting helps you see your sources of income less your expenses. You should minimize your expenses to the extent practical.

2. [Build an emergency fund.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_1.3A_build_an_emergency_fund) An emergency fund should be a relatively liquid sum of money that you don't touch unless something unexpected comes up. For most people, 3 to 6 months of expenses is good. A larger emergency fund may be warranted if your income is variable or uncertain. If you're in credit card debt, aim for one month of expenses and focus the rest of your money on paying down debt.

3. Don't check out of your finances. Continue following the steps in [""How to handle $""](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) as best possible starting at the beginning of the flowchart. If you can't make rent, contact your landlord. If you have trouble paying your mortgage, see below. If there are bills you can't pay, research your options and contact the company. Simply not paying a bill without any communication is almost certainly not your best option.

4. There's more good stuff you should be doing in this [video from Bogleheads](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Video:_Start_with_a_Sound_Financial_Lifestyle) and the [PF wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index).

# Travel

If you have travel planned, read *[Coronavirus & Your Finances: What to Know and Do](https://clark.com/personal-finance-credit/coronavirus-finances/#travel)* from Clark Howard.

Also see the [megathread on /r/travel](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/fha30l/europe_to_us_travel_suspension_megathread_for/) for news and updates on the US travel suspension and other impacts the virus is having on travel plans.

# Refinancing

[If you're in the market for refinancing your mortgage, it may be worth considering](https://clark.com/homes-real-estate/when-should-i-refinance-mortgage-2020/), but if you don't have a healthy emergency fund and extra cash, you may not want to refinance right now due to the up-front costs.

# Federal student loans (Minor update on April 10th)

The CARES Act has some provisions to aid people with federal student loans including:

- Borrowers will be able to pause payments on federal student loans until September 30th, 2020.
- There will be no interest charged against your federal student loans until September 30th, 2020.
- Involuntary collection of defaulted student loans via garnishment of wages, social security, and tax refunds is also being suspended.

Key points:

- Private student loans are not affected.
- [If your loan is federally-held, you do not need to take any action to suspend payments. Your federal student loan servicer will suspend all payments automatically. You do not need to contact your student loan servicer.](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-student-loans-and-coronavirus-pandemic/)
- If your loan is *not* federally-held (i.e., federal student loans held by commercial lenders), do not assume you can pause payments without contacting your servicer. You may want to look into income-driven payment plans.

Read https://myfedloan.org/borrowers/covid/ for more information and updates.

# Federal tax payment deadline, filing deadline, and IRA deadline extended to July 15th (Updated on March 28th)

Key points:

1. [Both the filing deadline and the payment deadline are now being extended to July 15th.](https://twitter.com/stevenmnuchin1/status/1241002750483324930)

  [The IRS has also stated that the deadline for making contributions to your 2019 IRA is now July 15th.](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/filing-and-payment-deadlines-questions-and-answers)

2. **State deadlines are not affected by the extension**, but some states are providing extensions (the terms may differ, though). [The AICPA is maintaining a summary of states' filing and payment guidance due to Coronavirus.](https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/advocacy/tax/downloadabledocuments/coronavirus-state-filing-relief.pdf)

3. If you are receiving a refund, you should probably still file earlier.

# Many mortgage owners will be eligible to have their mortgage payments reduced or suspended for up to 12 months (Updated May 14th)

Key points:

1. The law covers about [70% of all mortgages](https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=406472) in the U.S. (those backed by Fannie and Freddie, FHA, VA, or USDA). Many companies have similar policies for most other types of loans. If you aren't sure what kind of loan you have, ask your servicer.

2. In most cases, you will [not owe the missed payments as lump sum](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/after-you-receive-relief/#repay). There was a lot of confusion about this. The new guidance says that lump sums are not required for [GSE](https://www.fhfa.gov/Media/PublicAffairs/Pages/FHFA-Announces-Payment-Deferral-as-New-Repayment-Option-for-Homeowners-in-COVID-19-Forbearance-Plans.aspx) and [federal loans](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/SFH/documents/IACOVID19FBFactSheetConsumer.pdf).

3. You can't just stop paying your mortgage. Contact your servicer to find out if you are eligible for this or if your servicer has adopted a similar policy.

4. For more info, the CFPB published [step-by-step information](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/housing) about how to request payment relief.

# Retirement account changes (Updated on March 29th)

Key points:

1. The CARES Act provides an additional way for people to access cash by allowing the penalty-free withdrawal of up to $100,000 from qualified retirement accounts including IRA, 401(k), 403(b), 457(b), and several other types of accounts. It is also now easier to borrow money from 401(k) plans and the maximum loan size has increased to $100,000 from $50,000. Any loans due in 2020 are also being extended.

  In addition, some other rules related to retirement plan distributions have been suspended or modified.

  For details and **numerous warnings** about why you should try to avoid making early withdrawals, read these articles:

1503,personalfinance,Sole beneficiary of IRA. Siblings not happy.,"My mom passed away in April 2020. She had two IRA accounts. One goes to me 100%, with contingent beneficiary as my grandmother (who pre-deceased my mom). The other is split equally between me and my two siblings. They way it stands, I’m getting 75% of the total, while my siblings are getting just 12.5%. Needless to say, the sibs are not thrilled, and I don’t think the inequity was intentional. 

I’m trying to figure out the least complicated way to split the inheritance more equitably. I can’t disclaim any of the “big” one, or it would go to the estate. Can I set up some sort of trustee-to-trustee transfer, to divert some of the funds to my siblings, without incurring taxes myself? I don’t want to have to get into withdrawals and taxes and gifts, etc. 

Thanks in advance!!"
1504,personalfinance,I want and probably need to go to therapy but can’t afford it and don’t I think I will be able to for a long time. What should I do?,I’ve struggled with depression and feeling hopeless my whole life. The timing is pretty terrible that I’m finally deciding to do this now. I’m finishing up community college this year and transferring to university in the fall. I have only about $10k saved and need every penny I can get for school.
1505,personalfinance,Geico Premium Increase Even Including 15% Credit,"Edit at the top so maybe people will see it: **I am already switching**. Please stop telling me the answer is to switch insurers. I know. I already know to switch every few years, this was simply informational for those in the middle of their “switch cycle” who may not notice the rate increase because of the one-time 15% credit. If I hadn’t investigated further, my total for 6 months only increased $9 due to the credit. 



If anyone else has Geico, please check your policy documents when it’s time to renew. My premiums went up 19.77% for 6 months, and with the credit only being 15%, I am at a net loss. 

When I called, I was told “your make and model of car has become more expensive to fix or replace”. I have a 2013 Ford Escape, and have had no accidents or tickets to otherwise explain the difference. I’ve seen a few others on here talking about the same thing, with excuses ranging from “its now more expensive to insure everyone in your whole state” to “more people in your area are getting into accidents”. This seems to have all of the sudden happened since the pandemic started, so just a heads up to check your premiums (which you should already).



Edit: I do switch car insurance every few years, and I will be switching again this week, just wanted to point it out to those who may not notice a net ~$10 difference with the credit. I have car insurance with geico because I had to use them for renters since State Farm dropped me for having a single claim a few years ago, and I was bundling."
1506,personalfinance,"Store messed up my purchase, wants me to come back and pay.","On 5/23 I was given a receipt after making a purchase with my credit card. Card reader approved the transaction and everything seemed normal.

1508,personalfinance,Where’s the best place to keep my savings to buy a house?,"I (26M) have started to save up for a house. Quick facts:

- Live in Minneapolis
- Salary $54k
- $8k in emergency fund
- Own my car, only debt is $28k in student loans that I pay $200/month on

In three months I’ve tucked away $2k into an Acorns account. My rent was $1050/month up until last month, when my girlfriend moved in with me and started splitting that in two. 

The way I see it, I have an extra $500/month to tuck away as long as we keep our rent the same and I don’t take on any other debt. What is the most effective way to make use of this money? Should I keep it in the Acorns account, or move it to something else like a Fidelity house saving account? I’d like to purchase in roughly 3 years."
1509,personalfinance,Chase Amazon Visa replaced due to fraud. Amazon has new card number before I do.,"The title has it all.  I had a card get used for some unauthorized local purchases.  I am pretty sure I know what business it was skimmed at.  I got it turned off and a replacement card issued last week.  I don't have the replacement card yet, but Amazon does.  It was my preferred payment method and suddenly rather than Chase Amazon Prime Visa XXXX (old number) it is now Chase Amazon Prime Visa YYYY.  Presumably that is the new number, which [chase.com](https://chase.com) seems to verify.  The accounts are linked for the amazon points spending.

1510,personalfinance,New immigrant to the USA,"Hi there, hope this is the right subreddit to be asking this on.
I am a new immigrant to the USA and I am completely lost with how banking and finance work in this part of the world.

Back home there are only 5 banks in the whole country, here there are thousands, it seems, so I'm a little overwhelmed. 
Also what is a credit union? Are they safe? 
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you.

UPDATE: Thank you all for the information, I'm learning a lot about how things work here. 
Right now I'm leaning toward capital one (at least to start) because they integrate with zelle (can't find a credit union that does) and it looks like I'll be able to transfer money between them and my accounts back home easier. 
I am still reading all the comments so if anyone has any more thoughts I will be glad to hear them."
1511,personalfinance,Lost a large part of my life saving in the stock market,"I haven't been sleeping well for the past few months. I woke up every morning dreadful of what will happen to the stocks. Had many nightmares about losing all my money. Had many occasions when I felt sick in my stomach and wanted to throw up. Can't focus on work, which is terrible.

I am 28 (F), just graduated with a PhD degree. I make about $56k now as a post-doc. Earning potential is not very high in the near-term (social science field). I saved a lot of my salary and do side-gigs from time to time for some extra cash. I shared houses with roommates and worked my ass off when my friends were spending money and buying things. They bought apartments and condo with funds from their parents. Thought I can do the same but with my own money. I feel like all these efforts were wasted now that I lost $16k in the market (already took loss). I had about $78k in saving (now $62k) and this will set me back for at least a year. I was up before the March crash but then made a series of wrong decisions thinking I can outsmart the market. Looking back, I should've never invested money that I will be in need of in the next 2 years.

I really don't know how to mentally cope with the loss.

Edit: thanks for all the encouraging words. All the $78k were from savings. I didn't count in previous gains (which were of course also lost). It's on Robinhood, not 401K. I invested in a series of highly leveraged positions (bought spy put, FB put, LULU put). If these were stock positions I would've hold, but options decay too fast and with all the upward motion in SPY recently, my positions got destroyed. The worst part is, after I took loss this early afternoon, SPY and FB went down. After holding on to my loss and averaging down for so long, I might have finally sold at the top."
1512,personalfinance,Should I get a car?,"(20F, NYC) I'm thinking about buying a car instead of taking the MTA to go to work. Right now I'm not working, but I think I will have to go back to work within the next month. I currently live with my grandma, so I really don't want to take public transportation. I only make minimum wage ($15 an hour, usually working 35 hrs a week), but I do have $2,000 saved up in my savings account. I don't pay for rent or utilities, just food if I decide to eat out. My grandpa who passed away 6 months ago chose to give me $20k to buy a car with, my grandma is currently holding onto that money. I'm thinking about maybe using $15k to buy a used car, and saving the rest for car related expenses.   
I have to decide soon on if I should buy a car, and what type I should be buying if I do. According to Google Maps, if I drive to work right now, I'll be saving two hours every day.  I need more insight on how it is to own a car, insurance, maintenance, any fees, parking (Flushing), etc. Thank you for any help."
1513,personalfinance,0% Balance Transfer End Game Scenarios,"**TLDR** *- 0% promos expiring, reduced income = messed up pay down plan, reduced credit score means limited loan options. Seeking suggestions / advice.*

About a year ago, I delicately and with much thought, entered into what I call the Balance Transfer Shuffle (see old reddit post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/d30bra/the_0_balance_transfer_shuffle/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)).

Fast forward and turns out I'm sh\*t at paying off my debt (*actually, I'm quite good at paying off my debt. I'm actually terrible at earning income with which to do the paying*).

I started out with about **$24K** in debt with an average APR (dollar weighted) of **15.64%**. I'm now sitting with **$23,500** in debt with an average interest rate of **2.61%**.

I may be even worse at formulating an endgame strategy before the end arrives and the end is near. The strategy was to  pay down at least one of the $9K 0% balances, let credit rebound, then apply for a loan to consolidate the rest. Then COVID happened, work ceased, and the plan was mangled.

On the upside

* I accrued much less interest in the past year than I would have otherwise.

On the downside

* I'm *still* in the same amount of debt
* **Credit score** dropped *(760 ->* ***670***\*)\*
* Fewer/complicated options to earn *more* money due to COVID-19
   * *(Currently receiving UI benefits that will keep me afloat-but not flush--I'm a hybrid worker and am receiving under-calculated benefits-- until the CARES Act runs its course at the end of July)*.

Those 0% promotions will begin to expire in the coming months (**8/2020** *($9,200)***, 9/2020** *($9,700)***, 1/2021** *($800)*). I'm weighing my options and requesting support / advice.

I *do not* want to continue the 0% shuffle. No more new cards. *The 1/2021 card still has an active 0% balance transfer promo available until 1/21, but with a small credit limit.*

I have been saving all of my UI benefits and have $6K in the bank.

I'm not sure how likely it is that I'll be able to qualify for a loan to handle the $18K+ that will begin to incur. I'm still leaning toward this option with the thought that a lower APR is a lower APR even if it's for a reduced amount. However, I'm concerned about the effect this will have on my credit score.

As for lifestyle changes and choices, there's not much else I can do to spend less. My girlfriend and I live together, are staying home, and not spending money. We're even considering downsizing to a one car household even though we live in LA.

I politely asked if they could stop slamming their door as it’s loud in my apartment. She was rude but said ok. The boyfriend is a complete idiot. I have him on camera on my doorbell specifically telling his kid to slam the door, and I have multiple videos of them slamming it. My apartment complex refuses to do anything and says anything during regular hours is normal living. Hence why I took it amongst myself to ask the neighbor. It would be one thing if these people went in and out a few times a day, but they are in and out a minimum of 25 times a day. Each one with a loud door slam and constant noise. I am sick of it. I don’t know if they’re annoyed thinking I complained previously. However I asked them a few months ago to keep their door closed when they had parties (I don’t need people hanging outside my apartment door) and the guy later thanked me for talking to him. But now all of a sudden they’re making noise on purpose, and more so now that I asked them to stop. Can anyone help me? I have another 6 months left on my lease. However, the apartment complex needs to do their due diligence and all they do is brush it under the rug. I also want everything in writing. The last email I got from them last week was in response to my complaint telling me I need to be patient and accept that it’s normal living which is BS because these a-holes are doing it on purpose.

1518,personalfinance,Interest and penalty free loan to pay off mortgage,"In normal times I likely wouldn't consider this so I figured I would post my thoughts as a sanity check.

I am on track to pay off my home in \~3 years with extra principle   payments each month.  Recent legislation allows me to tap 100K in 401k funds interest and penalty free for 3 years.  The 401k account is healthy and I can take that amount from bonds which would at best would earn 3% per year.  If I   take that 100K and payoff the loan my thinking is I will come out on top with the interest I would be saving as long as I continue to save any extra cash flow each month and put it away for repayment of the 401K loan.

Mine might not be a sad story, but if I qualify for the program and I was intending to use my income to pay off the house prior to being impacted...

My main question is about the financial soundness of the thought.  If there is a moral or legal issue that should be further considered I'll accept that also.

When I checked my score it was down around 35 points. I checked further and found that there were 2 medical bills from over 2.5 years ago that had gone to collections.

The weird part is I have no memory or record of those medical bills. I had one bill from that hospital and I paid it.  I have been called by the collection company before, but I honestly blew it off because I always pay my bills on time and I thought it was a scam. The collection company never sent me any written notice of debt and I don't think I received any bills from this hospital for these amounts. Also the bills are from dates I was not at the hospital and for nice round amounts, which rarely happens with medical bills in my experience.

I am not sure what to do. I have looked online and on the wiki, but I am still so confused. Because the debt is so old, I don't know what rights I have or if I can dispute it. I really want to get the mark off my credit reports so that I can get the best mortgage rates.

1521,personalfinance,Mortgage Refinance - Did we make the right choice?,"Hi Reddit,

We recently signed for a refi and are in the 3 day waiting/cancellation period before the loan is funded.

I'm notoriously paralyzed by decision making and now that we're in the final stage, one where we're offered a chance to abort mission, I'm feeling very uneasy about making such a big decision. I don't have any family who own their homes so I haven't had anyone to bounce questions off of. I've felt very confident that the refinance was the correct decision but I'd love to hear thoughts from some folks outside of my own head. Details are below:

**The original loan:**

$328,500 original loan value, originated in May of 2018. Appraised at $365,000 We've made 24 (2 years) of payments. 5% rate. $300/mo in PMI. Total monthly payment = $2399.00

**The new loan:**

$327,200 new loan value, appraised at $400,000. 3.65% rate. $57/mo in PMI. Total Payment = $1880.00

We're saving just over $500 monthly. Our closing costs amounted to just over $7k which included a 2% origination fee. We know this fee wasn't particularly great, but navigating a refi during COVID times was not a fun task and we're accepting that for what it is.

With the savings, I'm seeing we'll hit a break even point at 14 months. We plan on staying in this house for at least another 3-4 years, so this seems to make sense. Saving $500 monthly after that will mean that we can be very comfortable with saving monthly.

I feel like I've partially answered my own question, but I just need some validation and or advice if this wasn't a ""good deal"". Is this refi a good choice considering the circumstances? Should we hit abort and try again once rates drop further? Should I just plan to refi in another year or so if rates *do* drop even further, but take what I can get for now?

Thanks for reading and for bearing with me. I wish I were a more confident person when it comes to decision making."
1522,personalfinance,Does it make sense to max HSA first?,"Hi PF,

I'm looking at my general finances and wondering if I should max my HSA before 401K in prep for retirement in 10 years.

**Details:**

**Income and Savings**

Me (56M) 95K salary

Wife (52F) 10k salary, self emp and still building her business money goes back into business. As it gets more established salary will increase.

$1.1M in 401K that I no longer contribute to. It's a bit aggressive (95% stock) for my age group will re balance to a targeted fund when its recovered a bit more. 

$19K in current 401K and contributing $9500 to it per year. Company matches first 5% only.

$2600 per year to HSA

Wife has \~$55K in Roth IRA's

$300K in various stocks

16K in bank for emergency fund (will be using about half for closing cost on home loan in next few weeks). 

**Expenses**

$1102 mortgage and $496 for Prop tax for total $1598 per month. Balance is $166,500 at 4.625% (refin at 3.125% should close in next few weeks). Home is valued at $739K HCOL area.

$396 per month min payment (I pay $500) for HELOC, current balance $46,200 at 2.75%

$2000 for util, Insurance, food, gas (we have 3 teenagers in the house...boy can they eat).

&#x200B;

Loans and expenses for the month totals $4100. Once refi comes through this will drop to about $3800.

CC paid in full each month. Mainly used to pay  util's not much extra spending with the lockdown going on. 

No car payments.

I've started looking into what our retirement looks like and I've done every retirement calculator I can find and it appears we would be set on cash flow through to 90 - 95 years old provided we don't become continuous world travelers. 

&#x200B;

So adding more to 401K gives us a cushion that while nice seems the $$ may be better somewhere else.  I'm considering:

1. Lowering 401K contribution to 5% or 6%  (about $360 per month) 
2.  Change HSA contribution so I max it. 
3.  Using the left over and the \~$300 from the new mortgage to first get the emergency fund up to $25K and then to knock down first HELOC then put all towards mortgage. 

My hope is to have the HELOC paid off in a few years (will sell stocks over the next few years to boost this goal) and have the house paid off or close to in about 10 years when I plan to retire. Not planning to take SS until I'm 70. 

Or with my rates so low am I foolish to pay loans off so quick and should max HSA and 401K regardless? 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Thank you."

1527,personalfinance,"Next month, I will have the money to pay off all debt (besides my car loan). Am I right in holding off?","Come next month, I will have the money in the bank to pay off all my debt. Which thankfully isn't all that much now, about $4300 (my car loan is another $5600).

Now one of my debts is $1800, which is interest-free until September, which I plan to pay off in full regardless. For the rest of my debt, however, I'm debating sticking with the minimum monthly payments (which are *mostly* interest, and come out to $95/month).

Here's my thinking;

That little bit of extra cash gives me a *bit* of wiggle-room, in case ""life"" happens. A coworker of mine said during the last recession, a lot of credit card companies were cutting peoples' available credit, and given a recession seems increasingly likely, I feel like I could easily find myself in a position with no debt but also no money.

Now, on the positive side of things, I've managed to cut my spending down quite a lot. I currently bring home $4,078 a month, and I've got my spending to about $2500 a month, which is a cool $1500 a month saved. So it wouldn't take terribly long to accrue enough money to pay it off and *still* have money in the bank.

I guess my thinking is, though, that I'm effectively paying $95/month in order in exchange for *not* paying $3200 off. Things are a little uncertain with my job (I'm personally kicking ass, but I'm in one of the less-profitable departments at my company and we're transitioning into an ESOP; this pandemic could not have come at a worse time), and I guess I just like to plan for the worst.

Or should I just plan on ripping off the band-aid as soon as I can?"

If I purchase a car in the 10-15K range I will put a big dent in my pocket with high insurance payments but will likely have a car that should last me a long time with maintenance.

In your opinion, what price range do you think is the optimal balance between not putting a big dent in your finances while also not having a clunker that requires multiple repairs and being a pain in the ass?

Budget: After maxing out 401k matched contributions, estimating take-home pay after taxes, and accounting for healthcare costs through work plans, monthly income will be around $4,800. I think rent will be around $1,800 (it is a very high cost of living area) and Utilities (phone-$35, electric-$75, internet-$70) will be $180. I have \~$24,000 in college loans which I plan on tackling with $800 every month. I think car insurance will be around $344 (this is the biggest guess of my whole budget because I am currently on my mother's car insurance but that will not be the case for much longer). Subscriptions will total $32 a month. Finally, food will probably be around $450 ($250 for groceries, $100 for eating out dinner, $100 for eating out lunch, sidenote: work provides lunch most days). That would leave around $1,000 I can put in savings for emergencies and other expensive purchases and the rest as flex money/debt money.

1546,personalfinance,Mortgage options after divorce,"My wife and I got a divorce about a year ago - pretty amicable, and we've been sharing the house and utilities up until this point. However, she's getting antsy (not that I blame her) and wants to jump into selling the house and move on.

My arguments against this are:

1) We have two larger dogs, which is going to put a damper on a housing search for both of us.

2) Neither of us can afford to carry a two mortgages or rent (Northeast US, where housing prices are insane.)

3) Even if we do sell immediately (alternate housing not withstanding) I'm not even sure we'd break even - I thinks it's very likely that we'd wind up owing additional money to the lender just to get out of the mortgage.

I don't really want to do this, but I'm thinking that my only option would be to:

1) Get an appraisal and figure out what we would be likely to get after all is said and done

1a) Somehow (with legal assistance) figure out how to equitably split any proceeds up to that point (if any) when the house eventually does sell

2) Refinance in my name only (stretching out the mortgage to 30 years again, but reducing it by about $300 a month)

The rest of our friends are our age and have put down less than 20% and are very defensive of that choice saying that anything more than 10% doesn’t really get you any advantages in terms of better credit scores, PMI was like $20/mo for them and would fall off when they hit 20% equity, payments weren’t significantly more, and they valued the liquidity in keeping more cash in their bank accounts. 
Now, I try not to pry into other people’s finances as a friend, so these are just the things they’ve offered up when I’ve asked for their advice, but it confuses me as a financial professional. I’ve run some numbers myself, but want to branch out to the community for fresh perspectives. 
My husband and I asked our financial advisors and they didn’t seem to feel very strongly one way or another. I couldn’t tell if it was because they thought we valued buying a home sooner rather than later (in which case we did not have 20% at the time we asked) or if they didn’t expect us to want to wait or what. 

With that being said, do first time, or other, home buyers still put down 20%? Does that old rule still make sense? Arguments for and against."
1549,personalfinance,Finance or pay cash?,"Hi! I have an upcoming medical expense of for an elective surgery.  $4,040 if paid in full, and $4,440 if I use their financing with 2 years no interest. 

I could pay in full using my HSA savings, which I generally consider to be a good deal due to being pre-tax money, however most of my HSA is in mutual funds, which are down right now. 

Or, I could choose the finance plan, make the payments while investing some additional money each month, hoping that as the stock market recovers, I could eventually more than make up for the extra $400 that it would cost to use the financing.

1551,personalfinance,Large Student Loans: Stay on IBR or Pay Off?,"For those of you with very large student loans currently on income-based repayment plans, what is the best route to take? The way I see it there are three options:

1. Try to pay the full amount off aggressively before the forgiveness period occurs
2. Continue to stay on an income-based payment plan and prepare to pay the tax penalty on the remaining balance
3. Try to balance between the two: make a larger payment per month than the minimum, but still prepare to pay once the loans are forgiven

I am fine with pursuing option #1 and get rid of the damn burdensome loans if it means that it will actually save me more money than option #2. I just don't know if it is worth trying to pay them all off, or if it is better to stick on IBR and pay the tax penalty. I don't understand how to calculate what truly financially is the best option at this point. 

About me: I am 34, married, no kids (but would like to have kids soon). Graduated from grad school in 2012. My loans say they go to 2031. My husband also has student loans. We have a mortgage. I make a decent income, I have no car payment or credit card debt."

I called his office because I didn't understand why I was being charged and why this specific room would be out of network when he is in network. 

He said that the charge was not an error. He said I had yet to hit my deductible which is why I owed 100 percent of the charges. He also said he was trying to see if the insurance would pay him anything for that charge. Since they aren't paying he would waive the charge for me.

I was recently diagnosed with something called middle ear myoclonus of the left ear, which is a form of tinnitus where I hear prolonged episodes of morse code like thumping behind my ear drum. Thankfully at the University of Pennsylvania, there is a specialty doctor that performs the procedure to fix the issue that I've been seeing. Last time I saw him in February, I was at a previous employer. I am scheduled to see him again on June 4th. However, I am in a new enrollment period to select health coverage for me and my fiancee. This is extremely confusing to me, and I'm already worried I'm going to end up getting hit with surprise medical bills. In terms of selecting health coverage, I'm not sure if I should just simply select the best option possible just due to the fact that I'm expecting a surgery. 

I have done some research in trying to figure out much this will cost me, but it's still ongoing. I have read to get the title of the procedure, and obtain the 5 digit medical code of which I'll be able to somehow cross reference with a billing system? Again I'm not 100% sure how to do this so any help is greatly appreciated. I've also read to always ask about surprise fees like facility fees, or whether or not the anesthesiologist will be in network. I'm 29 and this is the first major medical issue I'm facing as an adult. Luckily I have an emergency fund, but I just want to make sure I can do everything possible to cross my t's and dot my i's.

However, I have had two credit cards for almost 4-5 years now, and I practically have little to no debt in them. The thing is, I think I have been doing the whole credit card thing wrong ALL THIS TIME! 

When I make a payment with my credit card, let’s say it is $50. Most times I just pay it right back, either the same day, next day OR within a week just because I don’t like seeing that I owe a big amount. BUT, I believe that might be wrong of me to do so because then at the end of the day the bank sees no credit card usage. I have no idea if that is right, and that is precisely why I’m asking this question!

So, can you all amazing people of personal finance teach me HOW the heck I should be using the credit cards to my advantage in order to actually BUILD credit and give me your insights on how YOU do it?

The more I read, the more I am confused.","I have read as much as I could on IRAs and rollovers here on Reddit, within my benefits guides, etc, and I just can't decide what to do. My parents can't help me with this because we are all immigrants, and they have even less clue than I do. If it helps, I'm in CA.

I have about $500 in PARS retirement account from the time I worked as a temporary employee at a community college. These money are now being either disbursed to me or I have the option to roll them over.

Now, if I had a traditional 401K or some such that would be a no brainer. But I am a member of CalPERS, and when I asked about rolling over these money into it, I was told ""no"" by my HR Benefits Specialist.

My district does provide a 403 and 457 plan options, both traditional and Roth. It seems like my only option is to open another 403 account and rollover money into it. The problem is, they all have additional fees through 3rd party vendors incurred annually. The vendor's list is limited; the employer does not match contributions there because they already match CalPERS. I don't know if I should tie myself with another retirement account for these $500 and pay fees on them. I also won't be currently making enough to continuously supply a 2nd retirement account. It's just not feasible financially at this moment.

Ideally, I want an option where I deposit $500 into retirement, and they sit there, waiting for me to earn a bit more and contribute in a recurrent manner. A family member also suggested a Capital One option that is free of admin fees. So, I have three choices:

1. take out the money with penalties and everything;
2. open an additional IRA through my employer. I can compare [three cheapest ones](https://www.403bcompare.com/productComparison?product1=61&product2=68&product3=164): CalSTERS, Fidelity, and Vanguard. All three want annual fees.
3. open [a cheap Captial One](https://www.capitalone.com/bank/savings-accounts/ira/) not supported by my employer for automatic salary reduction.

My head hurts at this point, and all options look lousy. If someone could give me any kind of a suggestion, I would appreciate it."

I've been pondering this idea and I haven't been able to find a reason not to follow through with it and would love some input.

Married, 27 y/o, I have 33k in employer sponsored 401k fully vested, giving 15% a year with additional 4% match. 4k in an invested HSA adding 1500 a year, I make about 70k a year, wife 39k. Wife and I each just opened a vanguard Roth with $1k for personal retirement accounts.

With the current covid situation my job is stable (paramedic) wife had her hours cut by 25%, we are comfortable and still saving for a home.

I am thinking that under the cares act we can withdraw from my 401k without the penalty, only paying income tax, I would like to take 18-24k and nearly or fully max out each of our Roth's for 2019 and 2020.

My reasoning for this is because I will be an RN starting near the end of this year and take on a significant pay raise (90-115k a year). I also expect taxes to increase in my future with the amount of money being handed out. Is it dumb to take the tax hit now while in a lower income tax bracket and let it grow tax free? Then proceed to work on maxing my 401k first in the years to come?

1568,personalfinance,Question about settling with debt collectors and effect on credit report,"I currently have a credit score in the mid-740s with no derogatory marks on my account.

The total amount in question is about $160. I am wondering how would be the best way to handle this. Presumably if I do not pay them, a derogatory mark will be placed on my credit. However, is there a chance that this will end up on my credit report even if I pay? Or if I pay the settled amount rather than the full amount?

1569,personalfinance,Am I insane for even considering buying?,"I (21M) am a recent grad set to be making $60k in the southern US soon. The position I am taking is located in a coastal area, and because of this it seems like the availability of rentals is pretty strained. I'm just hypothesizing, but most of the decent rental properties seem to serve as vacation rentals rather than long-term housing. There is one semi-decent seeming newer complex that could be a good last resort for me, but I think they're able to charge a massive premium since it's the only updated complex in the area ($1,164/mo for a 1BR, and we all know this would increase massively after the first year). I think I would be willing to spend that much if the complex were located in an area where you could walk to activities (beach/shopping), but it's really nothing special.

There are, however, a decent number of condos for sale around at what I think are reasonable prices. One that I am looking at is a new construction 2BR listed at $177k, and I estimate I could have monthly costs of around $975 (insurance/tax/HOA included). I am lucky to have around $75k saved from windfalls, so it wouldn't be difficult to put 20% down, pay closing costs, and still have a good emergency fund leftover. My FICO is 744. I have no other debts, but I also will be in the market for a new [to me] car ASAP. I wouldn't be interested in renting out a second room.

The issue is that I have no idea how long I'd like to stay in the area. I think my job security would be good (it's with the federal government), but there is just no way to see into the future and see how much I will even like this job a year down the line. There would also be a small dating pool there, which isn't trivial to me. How unreasonable would it be to hire a property management company if I do decide to move elsewhere? I think the rental value of the particular condo I'm looking at would be at least $1,150.

Please feel free to tell me I am insane! I definitely think I would prefer to rent to start with, but I also don't want to be throwing money away on an overpriced apartment I don't even like when I have the opportunity to buy something I love."

I have all my other bases covered: life insurance, college fund, retirement fund, etc. I have no other debt.

I want to replicate something I did during the 2015 ""mini down turn"" which allowed me to buy the farm: cash out/refinance using my home's equity, buy a couple of properties in a low risk area, wait two or three years and cash out for a decent profit, pay back a good chunk of the refinanced loan and invest the balance in a vacation home.

1575,personalfinance,Pay Car Loan Faster vs. Save - Budget Suggestions Welcome,"Hey y'all - looking for some suggestions on my (M 26) budget. 

My biggest question is if it makes sense to pay down a car loan ahead of schedule to avoid interest, or put more of that money into a Roth IRA/other savings. Job's pretty stable, but my savings aren't built up very high so trying to be as smart as I can be. 

Monthly Take-home is: $3054.   
Monthly spend on rent, utilities, health insurance, food, & a few treats for myself (gym, hulu) equal $1800 (HCOL area). Can break this out if helpful but I don't think I'm doing anything too crazy - I know I should reduce this overall my partner will be increasing their contribution to shared costs soon when they finish school. 

I try to give away $100/mo to charities and friends that need help, I'd like to keep that up as well - so all told that leaves \~ $1000 for saving/paying for this car with a $100 buffer. 

Current Savings:  
Emergency Fund: $2500  
Roth IRA: $6300   
Regular IRA: $3000 (Set this up before I knew what a Roth was - not contributing to at present)

Current Car Loan:  
$11,100 over 46 mo. Payment is \~$242/mo on that schedule, and I'd wind up paying 4.9% interest all in. 

When I got the loan the idea was to pay it back quickly to save on interest, so for the past few months I've done:  
\+$150 Emergency Fund  
\+$400 Roth IRA  
\+450 Car Loan

TL;DR: Is it better to just live with paying some interest on the car and throw a the extra few hundred into emergency/retirement savings? Or are the numbers small enough that it doesn't matter?"

This is where I need advice. So I currently have a credit score of 439, i know it’s absolutely dreadful. The reason it is so low is because of my student loans- i went to college for a semester in 2018 and withdrew before spring 2019. (wanted to try it out) I was an idiot and ignored all notices from my university and got a letter from debt collectors that they had reported my late payments to the credit agencies. The student loan is the only missed payment on my account, and since they reported it I have made every payment and my credit has slightly increased each month. (about 8 points a month) But 439 is too low to get approved for an apartment and I’m wondering if I paid off my remaining loan balance(~$1300) If I would see any type of increase in my credit.

I am a **21 year old student**. I live in Europe and work a part time internship which runs until the end of August and earns me around 850€ net. A side from that I get 220€ from the government each month which sums up to **net earnings of 1070€ per month**.

&#x200B;

I currently live with my girlfriend in her mother's appartment and only have to pay 120€ a month. I am meticulously tracking my **spending** which averages to **800€ for a normal month** (including the rent and little to none splurging).

&#x200B;

I have **12k on my bank account** and **no other savings**. For saving I need to accout for

* My **living situation is kind of uncertain** as, at any moment I need to be prepared to get my own place should things not work out with my gf or if her mother needs her apartment back for herself. (Setup costs for a 1 bedroom appartment would be around 6k and ongoing rent between 500€ and 600€)
* I have a 15 year old **car** (I cannot sell) and need to be able to repair, if the need arises.
* My internship ends in August and it is **uncertain if I can get another job** right afterwards
* I will need to **buy a laptop** in the near future for university as I don't own one.
* I am uncertain if/how much I will be able to work down the line of my uni classes.
* I need to be able to cover ongoing expenses while saving up.
* I dream of upgrading my ""gaming"" PC and monitor.

I appreciate anyone who could spare some advice and hope I did not offend anyone in a similar position who might has it worse.

Also, I **cannot ask my parents for money**/support due to their financial situation and personal reasons.

**Huge thanks** in advance"
1579,personalfinance,Can't log into Capital one account. Help?,"Hi everyone.

I recently opened a savings account with Capital One. In the process, I entered an incorrect phone number (off by a digit). When I try to login with my credentials, the 2FA system gives me an option to either call the incorrect number, or send a text on it. As a result, I'm stuck and can't get through.

Does anyone know how to get to a human customer representative? Should I just abandon the account since it has no minimums or fees and I haven't put in any money yet.

My dad passed over a year ago, my mom says they house is yours just pay the bills on it since she doesn’t have his income any Ionger. 
So now it comes to tax consequences of our next steps.  First is she wants to just have me on the deed, but I stated to worry that would look like the house was given to me and might trigger some tax consequences? 
Also, if we sell it I want the basis to be the value at his death, as it would have been if he had died 2nd.

1584,personalfinance,23 y/o inheriting 40k after taxes. Not sure how to split it up.,"I’m pretty terrible with choosing good investments for money. I either end up loosing it, making good investments and then listening to speculation and panic selling— I always come out on the bottom and at a loss. 

I’ve inherited 40k and I want to do right by it. I want to take my time, make some good investments, and let it be a windfall that I can grow financial security from. 

These are my current balances:
* Car Loan: $16k @ 1.9% APY ($285/mo.)
* Trade-School Loan: $110k @ 1.3% APY (doesn’t impact credit) 
* Credit Debt: $3k

After bills and an 8% 401(k) contribution, I take home ~$1,600 after taxes. 

I was planning on dividing the inheritance money up like this: 
* $5k into rainy day fund
* $10k car payment, allowing me to bring the balance down to $6k which I would have paid off in under 24 months. 
* $25k investment into a REIT, ORIG, or other Real Estate fund

Is my plan solid? What would you do that you’d recommend I do? Another thought I had was to buy property, but I also fear my luck and a housing market crash."

I live in Southern California.

My old car couldn't run anymore, so it was parked outside of my apartment complex. Tried to have a junk company take it but they needed the original title and all I could find at the time was a copy. It was towed for not moving in a while, even though it had a sticker/permit to be there. That company took it, and I didn't hear from them after that. Sometime later I got a letter about a lein being put on the car, I thought maybe that meant it wasn't my problem anymore.

After that I got a fine from a city for street sweeping, and unpaid registration. Then I get a letter from a collections agency that is trying to collect an unpaid debt to a second tow company for 1800$. I do not have that, and would greatly appreciate any help."

I was always planning to leave this Summer to focus on school and I was always planning on just rolling it all over into my Roth IRA. However, I know there was some provision passed regarding 401k withdrawals in the CARES act and I am wondering if there is something better that I can do with the money rather than the standard direct rollover (which I believe is a taxable event going from trad to Roth). 

To be clear, I don't intend on spending the money. I am just wondering if there is a temporary strategy that is more tax-efficient."

Do I have to keep it there even though the funds are automatically withdrawn and invested via them and paychecks?

I deposit around 300 monthly to be able to max out my HSA and apparently with HealthEquity you can't invest unless you have 1k minimum in cash sitting there at all times.

[yes this relaxes the rule a bit. An update on the Updates Rule is in here as well]","**TL;DR on Throwaways:** If you wish to request relationship advice, please start your new username with `ThrowRA` -- it relaxes the content checks a bit on your post.

**TL;DR on Updates:** If you post updates: try to limit it to just one _unless_ you're asking for follow-up advice, and don't ever feel obligated to update everyone here.

---

**For regulars:** We took a LOT of good feedback on the two new rules (the Updates rule and the Throwaways rule). We're hoping this is a pretty good compromise between the concerns everyone raised versus the need to defuse some of the more prolific trolling:

 1. **Throwaways:** We relaxed the rule such that we're _not automatically removing every post from a new account._ In other words, every account can post to /r/relationship_advice.
* One bit of feedback we got is that a ton of people who post here are posting from new accounts because they've been led here from other platforms, e.g. facebook, twitter, tumblr, etc., for help. Knowing this, we changed how we're handling the rule. 
* That said, while we're applying content checks to posts more rigorously when they don't begin with `ThrowRA`, it's never an automatic removal.
* _yes, we stopped checking for the hyphen (It used to be `ThrowRA-`; now it's just `ThrowRA` and not case-sensitive). Apparently it's almost impossible to copy the text on mobile and include the hyphen, and tons of people were just forgetting it, so we dropped the hyphen._

 2. **Updates:** Updates asking for specific follow-up advice are totally fine. Updates that don't actually ask for advice are limited to only one.
* We recognize the gaping loophole this appears to leave, but honestly, it keeps the comments on-track with advice-focused conversation rather than derailed threads on unrelated topics like politics. 
* Apparently a lot of you _really_ like updates. So we're trying to strike a balance between updates and new posts.
* Any update that asks for specific follow-up advice (""Hey Reddit; I did this thing from my last thread, and this happened. How do I fix this?"") are totally fine.
* But back to back updates (""Hey Reddit! I did this thing today!"" day 2: ""Hey Reddit! Life's pretty good now!"" day 3: ""Hey Reddit! Thanks for all your help, we'll be together after all!"") -- Those can be condensed all into one post; the play-by-play isn't needed.
* In all honesty, I personally communicated this rule _very_ poorly. I'm genuinely sorry about that.

We'll revisit this during the next seven days to see how it's going with an open discussion thread at that point.

Am I the problem? etc. || Also, COVID-19 resources (thanks /u/ebbie45!).","We get the stress from social isolation is bad, but the subreddit is for asking what to do next, not whether what you did up until now was right or wrong.

The last time we posted this thread, we saw a pretty healthy self-correction, but we had to swap it out for COVID-19 resources (thanks, /u/ebbie45!) as the pandemic took hold. But now that we're neck deep in the pandemic itself, people seem to be resorting to using the subreddit to get a public judgment on their own household arguments. As said above, that's _not_ what the subreddit is meant for, and it makes it harder to mod the more serious topics where people actually have no one to turn to. As a result:

#One (1) day bans for Moral Judgment posts.

If that's hard to understand, consider whether you're asking questions that sound even remotely like the following:

* Am I the asshole--?

* Am I, or was I, wrong for--?

* Who's right here?

* Does anyone else--?

* Should/could I have done something differently in the past? 
 * _(this is different from asking ""Should I do [this thing] or [that thing]?"" in the future, which is allowed because it's a specific request for what to do next.)_

It was putting a big strain on our relationship as his needs weren't being met and he thought I wasn't putting in enough effort. So last week he finally managed to convince me to try it out, on the condition that I would still get a safe signal in case I really needed to stop. 

We agreed that the signal would be shaking my head side to side while grunting three times in a row. It happened last Friday afternoon. I was tied down and gagged very tightly. He used his belt to hit my butt and thighs. About three minutes into the session I couldn't take it anymore so I did the safe signal. He ignored it completely and started hitting harder and faster. He didn't stop until I passed out from the pain. It was by far the most painful experience I'd ever been through in my whole life. Once I recovered enough to be able to talk we had a huge fight and he expressed zero regrets, in his view he did what he needed to do in order to get what he wanted. He thought it was okay that he tricked me into it. We argued for hours and then I gave him the silent treatment over the entire weekend. Yesterday he told me to stop being a bitch about it and we had another big fight. I don't know how we're going to be able to recover from this. I'm sick and tired of everything. What should I do?"
1704,relationship_advice,"My (17F) roommates (45M 45F) asked me to be involved in a threesome and I declined, things have been awkward and now I'm moving out","TL;DR at bottom

I'm 17 and female living with a 45 year old straight couple.

Before you start judging, to make a long story short, I was in an unfortunate situation that pretty much led to me getting emancipated and I moved out of my parents home, I moved in with these people who were supposedly ""treating me like a daughter"" and for the most part they were like parents figures.

Let's get a couple things straight, I identify as female, but for the most part I feel more like a guy, I'm a 6ft tall which is very tall for a female, I work out and have a very muscular body, I'm flat-chested and the only girly thing about me is my long strawberry blond hair which I refuse to cut, but I don't want to be a trans man (nothing against it) so I identify as a cis female

Im also a Dom lesbian... with a sub girlfriend (19f)

I'm not going to bore you with too many details of how they approached me on this but apparently, they have a sex bucket list that includes having a threesome with somebody younger than 18, having a threesome with another female, and a threesome with another male.

Apparently they asked me because I am all of these characteristics rolled into one.

My severely uncomfortable facial expression was enough to let them know that they cross the line and when I declined, they tried to backpedal and make it seem like it was it just a bad joke but the damage was done and I was severely uncomfortable living there, I got some stuff straightened out and I'm able to move in with my girlfriend, which I'm doing literally tomorrow.

Thing is, part of me just feels bad, there is no way in hell I would ever partake in a threesome with these people and of course I'm going to jump at the opportunity to move in with the woman I love but I feel bad because these people have been like parents to me and now the dynamic is ruined

What do I do?

TL;DR: I'm a 17 year old lesbian girl with male characteristics living with a 45 year old couple who asked to be to partake in a threesome with them, I declined and am now moving in with my girlfriend tomorrow, I'm a bit upset because they were like parents to me and now that Dynamic is ruined.

Mini update: some of you have informed me that it's best to leave immediately and not wait until tomorrow, especially seeing how this couple might get hostile if they learned that I'm leaving, which they still do not know, I decided to pack up the little stuff I have and moving into my car, this consisted of a laptop, a phone, a duffel bag full of clothes and miscellaneous items, everything else was already furnished in the room so I don't own it and don't have to worry about it, I left my spare key on the kitchen table and make sure that I'm not forgetting anything, I'm currently parked in the McDonald's parking lot and I'm either going to sleep here or make the drive over to my girlfriend's"
1705,relationship_advice,I don't want to take part in my GF's (23F) sex ritual on our wedding night... but I still want to marry her,"My post was capped because I didn't have a throwaway account but I'd like some advice:

So I'm (23M) getting married to my GF (23F) early next year if all goes to plan. I don't have a lot of family (I'm no contact with my dad for several years now.) She, however, has a huge extended family.

For the most part we get on great. They tend to be very loud and have huge personalities, which is sometimes hard for me to deal with since I've always been on the quiet side. But overall very warm and caring people.

Something weird I've noticed since we got engaged is that my GF's cousins sometimes make jokes about our wedding night. It's weird for them to joke about it since I'm pretty sure her family is aware we've slept together before since we share a bed at holiday gatherings and vacations.

A few nights ago we were discussing wedding plans and thinking about places to go on our honeymoon (if COVID-19 clears up and we can travel by then). My GF and I were brainstorming ideas when she tells me that we won't need a bridal suite right away. Obviously I ask why (we're getting married at a pretty nice hotel) and she says that she'd like for us to stay at her parent's house.

I don't really mind this - we're trying to save money for a house deposit anyway - but GF seems like she has more to say so I push for why she wants it. She tells me that there's a really old tradition in her family on the wedding night.

The husband and wife go into the master bedroom together and they are supposed to 'consummate' the marriage. The rest of the family are waiting outside the door so they can applaud them and cheer when they come out. Then a piece of the bed sheet is cut off and sewn into a big tapestry my GF's mother owns.

I think my GF saw I wasn't happy because she quickly told me that we wouldn't have to actually consummate the marriage if I felt uncomfortable and we could just pretend.

I don't want anything to do with this. I absolutely freaked and told her under no circumstances will I be doing that kind of thing in front of her whole family. When I came back from taking a walk to clear my head, she was now noticeably acting down and still is. I think she's also been texting her family about this because I received a text from her mother telling me that I 'don't understand the importance of family' and tradition yet and this kind of tradition has been around longer than I've been alive.

I don't know how I'm meant to go on from here. I really love my GF and she is the woman I want to spend my life with. I'm freaked out of course but she is my whole world. But how should I handle her family and navigate his 'tradition'?

TL;DR my girlfriend's family have a tradition where they stand outside the room on the wedding night. I still want to marry my GF but I don't want anything to do with this. Advice?"
1706,relationship_advice,"My [31/m] wife [32/m] accepted a promotion requiring her to relocate to NY, yet 9 months ago we relocated to Seattle. She didn't consult me or our kids. According to her it isn't up for debate.","**Note** my wife is [32/f] not [32/m].

Both me and my wife[32/f] work in tech, she has always been a very career focused person. I work for a company completely remote. Last summer we relocated from Virginia, to Seattle for her new job opportunity, we discussed it a lot and this was something she wanted to pursue so i agreed with it.

We have 2 kids a 9 year old boy, and a 6 year old girl. When we moved last time they were very upset about moving. So much so that it has taken awhile for them to come around, but they finally started to make new friends. 

Last Friday she told me she was offered a more senior position at her company, she gets to lead some sort of consulting team. However the job is in NYC. I very quickly mentioned how we just moved, and how the kids are finally settling down, and how it would not be a good idea to take it. The payraise is peanuts. 

She shocked me by telling me:

1. She already accepted the position.
2. We need to start preparing to move now.
3. She wants to be in NYC setup by at latest start of July.
4. In the worst case me and the kids can stay here until late summer, and deal with selling our house, packing, etc. 

I got kind of upset, and our youngest heard us talking about moving who immediately decided to tell our eldest who became extremely upset. This entire weekend she left me with my kids so she could go work in the office to get stuff organized. She would come home and refuse to discuss it.

Last night i told her we needed to talk about this, and she became more upset then i have ever seen her be. She started screaming and yelling at me about how me and the kids are trying to ""Ruin her career"". I asked if in 6 months down the line after we go to NYC and you get offered a better position somewhere else if you would take it, and she told me yes. I have never seen her act like this EVER.

Both of our kids right now are in the i hate you mom phase, and it is making my wife even more upset. Today i tried to keep an open mind, and asked about things like where are we going to stay and live, etc. How are we going to put a down payment on a house or apartment (while she got a hefty relocation fee, it only comes after we move). She lost it started screaming about how me and the kids are trying to ruin her, etc. She told me this isn't up for debate, and if i or the kids didn't like it we should get out of her life. 

I took the kids and left quickly, they both don't want to move, and i really don't want to move ether. I came back and she was gone, she left me a message saying she was going to spend the night at her office because she is ""disgusted with me and our kids"".

My issue is i don't understand what is happening to her right now. We have been together for around 11 years and i have never seen her act like this at all. Up until last Friday, stuff was i love you/etc.  I am terrified and our kids are terrified. Can someone help me and explain to me what is going on?

**Update** Thank you, so many people telling me there was more to this then i thought. After looking up her boss and the only other coworkers name i really know on linked in, i am pretty sure the team she was on no longer exists now. One of her coworkers updated their employment history, indicating he is no longer with the company. While her manager has recently changed his role/title. I sent her a small message, and i hope she responds.

I really hope this isn't about dumb pride or something, and she has been hiding this. I am guessing she tried to change teams internally?

**Update 2** I messaged the coworker who seems to be laid off, he confirmed that their team was terminated, and this was almost a month ago that they were notified. People were given a bunch of time to wind stuff down, to try to apply/transition internally for other teams/groups. 

I am so very upset, she lied to me and treated both me and our kids like shit. She hasn't responded to my messages, but i can see her read receipts. I don't care if she is let go she can find another job, hell i have a ton of people in my network who i could have helped her get a remote job.

This just overall has put a terrible taste in my mouth, i don't understand why she isn't telling me the truth, and i am pissed that something this small is worth throwing away our family to her. I am going to sleep on it but thank you for your help.

TL;DR; Wife got promotion and has decide that we are moving, we just recently moved. I don't want to move neither do our kids, she is refusing to discuss this at all, and is terrifying us."
1707,relationship_advice,UPDATE: My [27F] sister's [25F] boyfriend [25M] took advantage of me and I'm unsure how to proceed.,"I can't link my original post here, but its only one of two posts in my account history. 

I want to start off by thanking everyone that reached out. It was comforting to know I wasn't going mad. 

My life has drastically changed since my post. I reconciled with my ex and we're now stronger than ever. He believed me right away when I told him everything and has been nothing short of supportive. 

After staying with my father, I returned to my mother's house to discover all of my belongings in bags. I mean everything. I wanted to get out of there asap so I loaded up and moved back in with my bf. Oddly enough, she didn't pack any of my child's things. When I opened everything I discovered a lot of my stuff was either missing or thrown away. 

A few weeks later I received court paperwork where she stated I stole from her and wanted an order of protection. With Corona, we had our zoom hearing and it was insane to watch her fake cry. She said she feared for her life if I was to continue living with her. I remained composed and my evidence was strong. I started from the beginning, even included the assault, which I could tell she didn't expect. The judge saw straight through her bullshit and no order was granted, but I was told to stay away from her home. Cool, fine by me. 

I had seen my counselor about twice since the assault. She had told me to ""shelve"" reporting the assault due to everything I was going through. I was disappointed to hear it because I did not feel validated. I don't think she ever told me she believed me or really wanted to offer support. I ended up reaching out to an actual sexual assault center and the experience has been completely positive. Right now it's hard to talk since I'm homeschooling and don't have time for a serious phone chat, but they've given me tools to work through my feelings. 

I started receiving messages from family members on Facebook saying they were praying for me. My mom still keeps in touch with a few family members on my dad's side and I come to find out she's been asking them for support in getting my child taken from me and have their father gain custody. Told them I was a drug addict and I don't care about my child.  I'm not sure what to do with this information. I now understand the reasoning behind saying I was a thief and wanting an order. It would have helped build a case against me. If she's willing to lie to a judge then I'm fearful about what other lengths she will go to. 

I'm also fairly certain she allowed my sister to keep some of my belongings. Nearly a third of my wardrobe is missing. I have spoken to neither of them since I left my mom's. I'm also convinced she stole my wallet because I recently received it in the mail with all my cards, IDs, and cash. 

I've also received some screenshots from my mom's facebook. She'll post pictures of my child saying she ""misses them extra hard"" today and I'm asked why I won't let her talk to them. I also felt that my dad overstepped by telling me I needed to ""mend things"" with my sister because then maybe my mom would stop her crusade. I took this very personally and I'm even considering cutting off my family completely, telling everyone to go fuck themselves and deleting all social media. 

Overall, I'm trying to not have so much hate in my heart towards her, but I truly have no more patience for the bullshit she's put me through my entire life. I'm going to move forward with my child and not look back."
1708,relationship_advice,Is it weird that I find sleeping with a girl who’s also sleeping with other men quite off putting?,"Like in the initial stages of dating, first few months, you never quite know who the other person is seeing. If I start sleeping with someone consistently, I really don’t like the thought of her being fucked by another man too. 

It means more to me than just a hole to get my rocks off. But I’m starting to think maybe I’m abnormal in that? It really really bothers me if the other person is sleeping with other men too and not just me. 

Questioning my mindset over the years. 

Is this odd? Thanks"
1709,relationship_advice,"My boyfriend (24M) is angry that I (22F) wrote a lesbian relationship, and I don’t know what to do.","I first posted this on r/AmItheAsshole,  but  was  informed  it  would  better  fit  here,  so  I  repost  it  here.

I love writing stories, and the characters I write are all rather diverse. I‘m also bisexual, and my boyfriend knows this.

Now, recently I began writing a fantasy novel while we were in quarantine together, and I‘m quite far along. My boyfriend is always pretty excited to see me write. He also sometimes asks me, if I have a character which represents him, which I find a bit weird. I normally never write about real people in my story. I just love to create characters from scratch and to let them act in a world entirely fictional. So I always say ""oh, those are only fictional characters, they represent no one"".

He seems confused by that, but doesn’t say anything else. I was almost finished with my story, when he asked me, if he could read it. I said yes, but he shouldn’t have too high expectations, because I didn’t really proof read it yet.

Now I should tell you a bit about the story.

It‘s basically about a princess and a maid falling in love in a really conservative society. Basically people want to marry the princess off, but obviously she doesn’t want that. This is basically the ""background"" of the story, but there is still a lot of other stuff going on which is too much to get into.

He read it in a few days, and he got really quite and avoided me. I was a bit confused, but thought his stressful work might be the reason.

He then confronted me yesterday night and asked me, if I really loved him. I said of course. He then asked me why I was writing about a lesbian relationship. Again confused I said that the story was interesting for me. He then accused me of self inserting myself into the story to live out my ""forbidden feelings"". We then began arguing with him requesting that they brake up in the story and the princess to end up with a male character he really liked. I then said I was planning for that character being gay, and him and the princess later to work together to escape their situation. He blew up at me and demanded I change the story, even kill the lover of the princess. I then also screamed, saying I can’t do that because I grew to love these characters and I want them to have a happy ending.

Now he doesn’t talk to me, and I don’t know what to do. I really don’t want to change my story, but I also want to mend my relationship."
1710,relationship_advice,I (25m) took my fiancé (27f) to a cabin in the mountains this weekend and her crying over missing her parents really bothered me.,"I have been together with my fiancé for 2 years, we got engaged 6 months ago and our wedding date is set october of 2021. So I will make this a quick story since the title says it all. I took her away on a mini getaway this memorial weekend up to the mountains while the cabin's internet was out due to storms; therefore, we did not have cell service or internet due to being in the mountains. She started crying because she missed her mom and dad and she did this three times during the weekend. This was not our first vacation together we have done around 8 out of state trips.

&#x200B;

This really bothered me because and it made me feel funny like maybe she didn't want to be here with me and would rather be at home with her parents, and it made me think that she couldn't be away from them. I told her there are going to be times in our life that when were not going to see our parents. I felt as if I was not number 1 and this will grow into a bigger problem in the hindsight of getting married and her parents will always come before me. This worries me because is it going to be like I don't have a wife when we get married she is going to worry so much about her parents and what they are doing and visiting them everyday. A snip of the future her parents know we are buying a house in a new area that have no construction homes so now they said they are going to sell there's after we move and buy one close to us. its only 45min drive away from where they live now.

I also have a cruise booked for us in October for a week and she begged her parents to come so now guess what they are now going on a cruise with us."
1711,relationship_advice,My (24F) boyfriend (26M) isnt taking care of himself,"Throwaway account. 

I need help.

My boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years and it's been pretty smooth sailing until quarantine. Now he is home all of the time working from home during the week. His diet has completely fallen apart in the past 2 months. He is eating terrible food like fast food, chinese food, pizza , ice cream, cookies, etc and gaining weight. He is also always up until 3am playing video games then sleeps in. Our meals are planned separately so he can go out and get his shitty food. 

He does not go outside unless he has to, which is sad for me to see since the weather is so nice now and we could be walking or doing something together but he doesnt want to. I've stopped inviting him to do stuff with me because he either rejects me, or he is miserable the whole time and denies it when I ask him why. 

What's really annoyed me lately is that we also have pets and he has not been doing his fair share of taking care of them. The times he is supposed to feed & let them out, he doesnt and the poor animals are left holding it & starved all day until I feed them. I feel like I cant leave our apartment more than a couple hours because they wont get to go to the bathroom. 

As far as dishes, vacuuming, laundry, and other house chores that is pretty much up to me as well unless I repeatedly ask him to do it or make a big deal about it. I feel like a maid, as I have to clean up our dining table & computer area of old food and soda/Gatorade bottles and our coffee table of his McDonald's/Wendy's food left overs. He will just leave it out for days until I throw it away. Its disgusting. 

TBF to him his work has been stressful lately as he is working on a really hard assignment and I think he is struggling, but also refuses to talk about it to me. Whenever I try to talk to him about it, I get, ""I really don't want to talk about this right now."" He has not always been this way, I believe he is going through a depressive episode and I'm not sure how to reach/help him."
1712,relationship_advice,(update)Unintended pregnancy from a 3 way,"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gosac3/unintended_pregnancy_from_a_3_way/

Thought I would give everyone a final update on this.  First the good news, my g/f friend has agreed to terminate.  She and my g/f spent the weekend talking and I had a conversation with her (with my g/f there) and basically informed her how I was neither ready to be a Father nor was I excited about being a co-parent with her.  I of course said I would do what was legally required of me but that life going forward would be nothing but complications.

We all three agreed that at best this would be an awkward relationship and I really expressed my sadness about being an absentee father and that I was afraid the mental damage it would do in the long term to both the child and honestly me.  

After that was all taken care of I then had a honest and frankly brutal conversation with my g/f.

I told her and reminded her how I did not want to do this.  How I felt that it was fucked up because I only ever wanted to be with her and how she knew I never had been with anyone else.  I told her that it has honestly fucked me up because physically I enjoyed it (obviously) but emotionally it had wrecked me because while I loved her I now was having fantasy's (frequently) about her friend.

I know logically I don't have any feelings for her but now that I have been with her sexually whenever I see her or talk with her that is all I think about, which even I find to be fucked up but I can't help it.

I told her that at least for the time being I can't be around whenever her friend is going to be around if they are going to remain friends.  I also told her I am not going to be comfortable if the two of them do anything beyond just being friends and by friends I mean non-sexual friends.

She at first got mad at me but then quickly apologized and said that it was true that I did tell her initially I did not want to do it.

So with all of that in mind, I am relieved that I am not going to be a father with her.  That my g/f has admitted and now is apologetic about cornering me into a three way.  I now have to figure out some way to get these very intrusive sexual thoughts and desires out of my head."
1713,relationship_advice,My (27M) girlfriend (23F) cheated on me a few weeks into our relationship.,"I just found out that 5 weeks into our relationship my girlfriend cheated on me with someone she knew for a few months before we met. I did not find out about it in the most honest way, she was drunk and left her phone unlocked. We’ve been arguing a fair amount lately and I had a feeling something was up which is why I looked through her texts. I found messages that took place 5 weeks after we started dating with a guy who she met up with at the time explicitly told hookup. After she cheated, the same guy kept reaching out to her and she ignored him. I confronted her on it and she denied it. I showed her proof via the text messages and she went silent. She started crying and I told her we were done. We’ve been together for 10 months and this rips my heart out. Should I look past this because it was so early on in the relationship or leave? Part of me wants to look past it because I love her but I feel like I’m validating her cheating if I do. I still love her but I have no idea how I’m going to be able to process/accept this."
1714,relationship_advice,My husband told me I suck,"So I'll try to keep this as short as possible. But my husband does absolutely nothing to help around the house or with our child. I tried to have a serious conversation about why he does he think it's okay to put his PC games over his family but he didn't even dignify me with a response but had plenty to say through text. I know I probably shouldn't have said this, but I gave him until July until I make my final decision about a divorce because I'm tired. It's been 3 years and it's only gotten worse after our daughter came along. 

He basically told me I was a bad mother to my face, a shitty person who does nothing, and that I suck and act like I know everything and that I act like I'm so perfect. (I'll try to figure out how to attach pictures.) He said for me stop saying things I'll never do or achieve (the divorce) and that I need to get my license and stop relying on him for everything. I've been trying to get him to ride with me so I can practice, he won't because of his computer games, and I rely on him because he said I could be a stay home mom and wife. Guess I shouldn't have took it literally. Yet I cook, clean after him, all the childcare is on me, try to not bother him when he's on his games, but that's not good enough I guess. 

I talked to my brother about this and he said it was ""too early"" but I'm tired in every aspect. My mom just says ""well he's a guy and likes his games"". I need unbiased opinions on if I'm the right or wrong for wanting to leave. Please help, at my wits end"

so backstory, My old friend group started going to parties that I would find out about when i saw it on their social media and found out they kept things a secret and were distancing themselves from me. Knowing the cliche i was in a tried to talk to them about it and after each person took their runs insulting me i was told to stay away. they are all quite artsy with most being actors. I promptly left and I now only have my GF and the theater director. he's a (M30) but gay and were good friends (he's my teacher, director and friend and we send memes to each other) because I know all the technical parts of the theater. I explained the situation to him and he gave me the balcony as my new place. our theater has an audience section and then a smaller second floor version that has the light and sound control. the theater is off-limits during most hours and the balcony is rarely open yet I was given full 24-hour access approved by the head of school so long i do all the lights and sound for them. (Easiest yes in my life). now that I spend time up there with my GF and her two friends word got out of my new power position. my old friend group has been asking to join me since they love the theater and can only be there during rehearsals.

1716,relationship_advice,I'm becoming very uncomfortable about the statements my [M22] girlfriend [F22] makes about men.,"My girlfriend of about a year has always been a very strong proponent of gender-related issues, generally leaning heavily towards women's issues and feminism.


I was exposed to a lot of this my first year of college before I met her, so not a ton of it is new to me, but lately I've been getting more and more concerned and uncomfortable about the statements she makes, primarily the ones about men.


Sometimes we've gotten into fights and she's said ""God, men suck"" to my face when I'm the only one in the room. I said I wasn't sure how to reply to that and she said that it didn't matter, if I took any issue with it that it was my ""male ego"" simply reinforcing what she said.


There's been other issues too and they seem to be happening more often. This week she's been talking about how ""all men are fuckboys"" and even went as far as to insuinate I probably got with her just because I wanted to get laid.


Other stuff isn't as bad. I'm a big proponent of allowing men to be accepted in feminine gender roles, as well as not circumcising guys. I opened up about those once and she mistakenly thought I was trying to get her to be an activist about them and said that as long as women's issues were still prevailing that she wouldn't put forth any effort to make men ""more comfortable"".


I understand she's very female focused but I'm starting to become unaware of what's actually my ""male ego"" getting in the way of my understanding or what is normal in these types of situations. I'm starting to feel vaguely unwanted and don't know what to do or how to approach things since my intent always seems to be questioned (or usually assumed) when I bring things up."
1717,relationship_advice,Gf refuses to speak to me after asking her to put her dishes in the sink.,"My GF (24) hasn't spoken normally to me for the past 3 days because I (21) because I asked her to make my life rasier by putting her dishes in the sink for me to wash.

Backstory. My GF works and I do not because I'm still in college. I have accordingly adjusted my life to hers. To make her life easier. She works from home and since we are under quarantine I took it upon myself to make her life easier by doing most if not all of the hoise work. Cooking and washing the dishes being the most relevant right now. 

I do the cooking and dish washing along with making coffee etc, if and when she needs it. 

Recently she mentioned how she felt bad that I have to do all this and she is unable to help me due to our circumstances. So in response I told her that if she feels that way then she could make my life easier by at least putting her bowl or cup in the sink so that I can clean it. For some reason she took this very personally and exclaimed that she can't do that because she's too busy in her work. I find that hard to believe due to the fact that she takes breaks occasionally to browse instagram. About 10mts. 

I've told her that if she has time for that then she could at least put the dishes in the sink in much less time. She now only speaks to me very passive aggressively and has told me that she thought I was doing all this because I loved her(I was but there is a limit) she thought my love for her was unconditional and that she was foolish to think that I was doing all this out of the goodness of my heart. 

She has asked me not to do anything for her from now on and she will do whatever she wants when she feels like it. 

I tried talking to her about it yesterday but she asked me not to talk to her and to just do what I want here quietly or I can pack my shit and leave. She has stated that she feels that her phone is better than me because at least it doesn't bitch about things. 

I've kept quiet from then on and have been seriously considering leaving because she refuses to talk to me normally or resolve the issue in any way. 

Am I overreacting or ......?

Edit: she is now ordering takeout and expecting me to eat as if there is nothing wrong. And is still refusing to speak directly to me.

Edit 2: I've tried talking to her about the issue again. And she is making fun of everything I am saying and has told me to my face that she does not want to co-operate with me and does not want to do as she is told. It seems there is nothing left for me to do. I will be packing and leaving tomorrow"
1718,relationship_advice,My stepdaughter (24F) didn’t invite her dad (55M) to her wedding,"The title pretty much sums it up. My husband (55M) asked me to post this. He has three adult children from his first marriage. He was married to their mother until the kids were 13, 10, and 8 (about ten years ago), at which point they separated. My husband was not as involved as he should’ve been After the divorce, and drank heavily at the time (sober for five years now). He was able to mend his relationship with all three children since becoming sober, and acknowledges that he made a lot of mistakes and is incredibly sorry. 

His oldest daughter (24) is getting married. She invited us to her engagement party and everything between them seemed fine (no arguments or drama etc.). Anyways, today we found out from her sister that the wedding is in a few weeks and we weren’t invited, her sister didn’t really know why and we didn’t want her to have to be in the middle of it. He asked if it was going to be a small wedding but apparently they invited over 100 people. My husband is very heartbroken but respects her choice. He doesn’t understand why as everything seemed to be going well; he expected that she wouldn’t ask him to walk her down the aisle or anything like that but was shocked she didn’t want him there at all. He feels like her actions make it clear she wants nothing to do with him, and he doesn’t want to push it fearing it will ruin any chance at having a relationship in the future. My question is how should he proceed? Should he ask her about it? (He doesn’t want to cause any drama) or should we send a gift and well wishes and not say anything about the invite? Or just not mention it at all? 

Thank you guys in advance."
1719,relationship_advice,I hooked up with a friend and the condom broke. I insisted she should take the morning after pill and she got really angry because of this.,"So I was at a friends house having drinks with her. So one thing let to another, and we had sex when we were both really drunk. 

After the deed I noticed the condom broke, and I'm about 90% sure I finished inside her, I asked if she wants to take a morning after pill since I'm really scared about having an abortion on me. We're both in our early 20's, single and I'm definetely not interested in a relationship, let alone raising a child with her. She feels the same way about this, so I expected her to agree. 

She disagreed however, claiming she ""knows her body and feels she isn't going to get pregnant"". She didn't believe me when I told her I finished inside her as well. I was drunk and I should've been more understanding, but I insisted she should take one to avoid a potential abortion. I have read myself up on this alot since I feel like having unprotected sex in the responsibility of both adults. I just wanted to be responsible about this. She insisted it's impossible for her to get pregnant because shes not ovulating. So I pointed out to her it doesn't work like that. She took this completely the wrong way and got angry for me telling what she should do with her body and that a morning after pill makes you menstruate for 3 months? That's complete bullshit so I sent her a webpage about how the morning after pill works, and that you can still get pregnant your entire cyclus. Wrong move.

She kicked me out of the house, leaving me outside for me to walk home for 4km, without a coat at 5am. When I got home I texted her a long apology for pressing her to take the pill while she doesn't want to. But I feel like I still have some point. 

Am I at fault for a condom breaking and wanting to take the proper precautions saving us from a potentially life changing chain of events? Is it not my responsibilty? I feel like an absolute dickhead and I don't want to lose her as a friend, but she hasn't been answering my messages and I'm freaking out.

EDIT: I offered to pay for the pill completely as well."

The morning when she got home, her phone received a notification when she was sleeping. The messages were from an old college crush. Apparently she has been meeting him for sex instead of visiting her sister. This has been going on for over a year. She has met at his place, and our place. They were also emotionally involved. She asked him for more sex than she did with me our entire marriage. She managed to meet with him, whenever I was away at work, or with my friends. I confronted her, and she tried to lie about everything. I backed her in a corner with evidence, and she eventually came clean. She cried, and  tried apologizing serveral times, but I left the house. I had small suspicions over the years, but thought I was just being paranoid.

 We haven't had sex since we've been married, and have been through counseling. Everything was great in our relationship otherwise. There was nothing wrong with her sex drive, she just enjoyed sex with other guy, and coming home to  paid bills. I am so depressed and angry. I did everything I could to be a great husband. I didn't deserve any of this. This will most likely cause trust issues in my future relationships.

Edit: We have no kids or own property together"
1721,relationship_advice,"My twin brother (16M) heavily radicalized into the Alt-Right, and I (16M) have no clue if I can or should help him.","I’m not entirely sure if this type of post is allowed, but this seems like the only sub that vaguely fits the issue, and I honestly just need any pointers I can get.

My brother and I have always been fairly adverse. We fight a lot and are basically the polar opposite of each other (ones smart the other strong, that sort of thing). Anyways, following that trend as we grew up our ideologies diverged, to the point where he’s on the ver of being an actual Nazi. (He legitimately believes that Muslims and Native Americans are all serial rapists, and that gay people should be put into “colonies”.) I know exactly how he got to this point, because I almost did too, and nobody would be surprised to hear it was through the “Anti-feminist” part of YouTube. I’m extremely worried about how this is going to affect his life, seeing as he already does horribly in school; I mean nothing would ruin his life more than being a barely literate Nazi...

If this is the wrong sub I apologize, this just seems like it could possibly be a good place to start. And advice, or other subs I could visit would be extremely extremely helpful."
1722,relationship_advice,"I (20F) accidentally found a picture on my boyfriend’s (22M) phone of his ex in her bra and underwear, asking if he likes it, saved last September (a year after we began dating)","Now, I’m not sure how to feel. Last night I got up and looked through his pictures because there’s one of us I like and he hasn’t sent it yet, though I asked him to. I planned on sending it to myself and posting it to my social media. When I picked up his phone, he had an email notification and so it opened his gmail when I unlocked it (relevant) I closed it and went to his photos.

As I was scrolling through his photos I guess I was just kinda browsing them, he had some cute photos of him that he’s never sent me, so I was just being nosy I guess. Then, saved September 2019, a year after we got together (and a month after I caught him messaging an old friend saying she was hot and trying to link up), was an almost-naked photo of his ex girlfriend, whom I’ve expressed some jealousy and discomfort of because she seems slightly more his type, and because he liked all her scandalous pictures. Nothing crazy, but told him it made me feel a little bad about myself, and if he could maybe refrain in the future. He had unfollowed/unfriended her on everything previously. I have no clue how/why he could’ve saved this photo. 

He insists he has no clue how it got there, and I want to believe him. He says he must’ve accidentally saved it when cleaning out his snapchat, but when I pointed out that you can’t save other people’s pictures on your snapchat memories, he seemed kind of stuck. He also accused me of looking through all his stuff, because his gmail was open, but I told him if I wanted something scandalous I wouldn’t look at his damn email lol

I want to believe it’s possible he saved a nsfw picture of his ex without knowing it, especially since I think he was really trying to redeem himself with me when this picture was saved, but I can’t help but feel uncomfortable and gross about it. I don’t want to make a big deal out of this, especially since I feel so guilty for using his phone. 

So I need an outside perspective that isn’t biased towards me (like my mom). Is it possible he could’ve saved it accidentally? What should I say to him that doesn’t make me look like a dramatic nut job? It was almost a year ago, am I still justified in being upset? He hasn’t done anything remotely untrustworthy is so long."
1723,relationship_advice,Has anyone's marriage successfully survived infidelity?," I (50m) am going to leave all the minor details and heartbreak out.  20 year marriage, two kids, mostly always great, thought everything was great, had normal ruts but also great lasting periods of love and great times. I truly, honestly believed we were the prefect couple.

She (46f) has suffered from anxiety and depression starting about 6 years ago.  I DID do everything I could, actively, both emotionally and physically. I also supported her through schooling to become a professional in her dream career. It was hard on her and that's where the affair started. She has been a little distant over the year but it ramped up over the last weeks which is why I finally decided to stop pretending and find out for sure and I did.  I believe she wanted to be caught because she knows I am an expert in the field of finding out things I need to electronically and she left huge signs everywhere for about a week (at the end).

Long story short, She had an affair for a year, I found out, confronted, kicked her out.  Next morning (after confirming she went to a friends house, not to the other person) She texted with self admission, self-hate and extreme remorse.  She came home, we talked.  All contact has been eliminated (as much as I can realistically ""prove"").  Her words and actions have been nothing short of miraculous. Acknowledgement, remorse, confusion on why she did it.  She says all the right things, all the things she used to say when we met, she's open and honest. We are both more open and honest than we have ever been and we have had a sexual awakening (which I now know is hysterical bonding or at least started out that way). We have talked more in the last 9 days than in a year and it's not like we were particularly silent.  We've both cried and she's sobbed so hard I actually got worried about her health.

She knows her family was almost ruined, she knows I love her. She knows she almost lost everything.

As you can imagine, between the self-pity and mind movies, it's still exceedingly hard for me and I was prescribed an anti-anxiety med (when I asked my doc for an STD test - negative btw). It's extra hard for me because even though I know there is no reason or excuse to cheat, I am partially responsible and that's almost as hard to deal with, coming to terms with my small part and also thinking it's not at all my fault.

The meds are supposed to take weeks to kick in but I feel a lot calmer and a lot more accepting, I believe this is due to my love for her coupled with my belief she is being open and honest and does indeed still love me dearly and she got something into her head over time, had someone tell her all the right things (that I also said but was ""expected"" to so had less meaning) and ran with it like an idiot.   I have been in the position before (more than a few times) where an attractive female has come on to me, knowing full well I was married and telling me all the right things.  I was certainly tempted and while I did not follow through on any part of it, I could have easily and still loved my wife just as much. (is this just me irrationally rationalizing?)

I am hopeful for our future. I think I should be really angry, not accepting and not *want to be* hopeful. I mention the meds because I hope it's not the drug playing tricks on me. 

Everything has changed, everything is better, this is the woman I fell in love with. I have always desperately loved this woman. But she slept with another person for a year on a weekly basis...  I am not sure I can ever trust her again and also not sure if I ""need"" to, if that makes any sense, probably doesn't.

So I am just wondering, has anyone (here) survived and prospered through a long term infidelity? If so, any advice? Are my positive feelings right now just a reflection of not wanting to lose her? I am just really confused on why I am not constantly flipping out and why I am so ""accepting"" (if that's the right word).

***EDIT:*** Thanks to everyone who has responded, positively or otherwise.  The number of negative is starting to be outweighed and I didn't really want to come in here and have a dozen people talking about cumming in my wife, so I am going to stop visiting.  Thanks again."

1725,relationship_advice,"Ghosted after 8.5 year relationship of traveling the world, helping her through university and medical school.","Approximately 3 weeks ago, the person who I thought was the love of my life and soon to be fiance, ghosted me after an 8.5 year long relationship and blocked me across the board after a one liner WhatsApp msg. Our relationship wasn't ""perfect"", nonetheless prior to this, it was pretty good. We were always very supportive of one another, treated each other with love and respect, every minute we spent together was filled with love and passion. We occasionally had small disagreements, as most couples do, but we worked through them. Our values were aligned, shared interests and goals, and we literally couldn't keep off of each other up until the last time I saw her before she went back to uni for her final year in med school. We're also both HSPs (highly sensitive person) so we had a shared understanding of some of the issue HSPs have. After such a long time together, the passion when we were together was always strong - which is why I am so shocked about what has happened. Up until recently, she couldn't wait to come home from uni and I couldn't wait to see her, both excited for the next chapter in our lives together. We had planned our names out for potential children, and both always became excited at this prospect. We had discussed parenting styles, goals, etc, many times. When we made love it was passionate ""making love"", not just sex, and she literally would say it was always amazing.

Nonetheless, last year a series of events happened at her uni that really hindered her academic progress due to another student stalking both of us across social media, harassing her, and doing everything he could to try and ruin her because she did not reciprocate his ""feelings"" for her. He sought out revenge because she rejected him when he mistook friendship for more and we're fairly certain he has Asperger among other personality disorders, thus he is not fully comprehending the consequences of his actions and not processing events rationally. Nonetheless, the university was very hesitant to take any action despite the student stealing her property and physically damaging school property to try and destroy her study space. They claim there wasn't ""evidence"" and it is ""here-say"". In fact, another female student that lived with this guy had also suffered a traumatizing experience from him and she was forced to move to a different living space for her own mental well being, but in many medical schools there is a culture of sexism where often women are just asked to ""tough it out"".

With the above in mind, it really bothered her to the point of likely causing trauma but she wouldn't see a therapist. Actually, even for me as I work through with a therapist now, I'm realizing this guys actions have even caused some trauma in myself as I was not able to be there in person to protect my gf given she was in a foreign country. However, I literally did everything possible to support her through this difficult time remotely and flew across the Atlantic several times when she couldn't fly home. She pushed forward and I did my best to support her emotionally through countless late night phone calls with her in tears, countless nights of staying up when she couldn't sleep; I made her feel safe and just hearing my voice would help her to sleep. Throughout her entire time in med school and prior, I was there to support her as best as I could. Whether it was helping her to write assignments, prepare presentations, or actually writing quite a few of her assignments for her because she was so busy with clinic and overwhelmed (for the record, I've seen many other partners in med school help or actually write assignments for their partner), I did the best I could for her. Last year, I myself almost burnt out commuting from work only to come home and help with assignments, having no time for myself. Nonetheless, I loved her and I thought this is what love is - to support your partner through thick and thin.

Anyway she had just about made it through and was getting close to concluding her time at uni when COVID19 happened - she had to rush home before the remaining flights were cancelled. She made the last flight and spent 14 days in isolation at her parents place where she has now been living for the last two months.

Three weeks ago we had a small argument over the phone where after having put her first for so long, now that she was having more free time, out of frustration I argued that I wish she would place more time for us rather than her parents and brother (big mistake given her culture prioritizes parents/family first). A few days later, I found myself ghosted and blocked across the board. I'm devastated and in disbelief. I've had to have several sessions with a therapist to process this because it happened at such a difficult time with COVID19 isolation and already not being able to go out.

Honestly, any advice anyone has would be appreciated. My initial reaction was to reach out, I wrote her a long love letter acknowledging and apologizing, delivered her a bouquet of roses to her door with the letter, but she won't contact me at all. Last week I finally stopped sending occasional emails asking to talk to her, my therapist suggested this to try and take back control of my life rather than letting the emotions of this situation have control over me; actually, virtually every online article about ""no-contact"" rule also states something similar. I am just really at a loss. I don't understand how after 8.5 years, after so much, after bleeding my heart dry to support her through the most difficult and demanding time in her life - she can just cut someone loose like that."
1726,relationship_advice,BF has never planned a date and spends all his time gaming...advice?,"So this is a throw away because well my BF lives half his life on reddit.... though i doubt he checks this subreddit. 

Anyways.... 

My boyfriend and I have been together for a long time now (over 10 years) and we have been living together for about 5 of them. When we first started to live together we had one TV and not a lot of room so he would game on our one tv. Often times late into the night, but usually never past 1or 2 most weekends and 11 or 12 during the week. 

This didn’t make a difference to me because I was in college and usually up most nights studying late and it was nice to have him right there to talk to. On the weekends it was basically the same. He would play games all day/night while I study. We didn’t go out often because well I was a busy college student and neither of us could afford it. 

Well I graduated and ended up with a pretty decent paying job and he also ended up finding a better paying job as well, and we moved. 

We got a bigger place and he was able to have a “game room”. I was perfectly okay with this, especially considering I enjoy gaming too and I was working a job that meant I had to get up early (like 5am early), and also studying to go back to school. I thought that this separate space would allow me some extra quiet time after work to study. 

I got that. Plus a lot more. He began spending ALL of his time in the game room. He would come home from work and go in there immediately, leaving only to use the restroom or grab a drink or snack until 2-5am on weekdays and 5-8am on weekends. 

I worked some weekends and would go to sleep around 10-1030 the night before and get up for work and he still hadn't come to bed. He would be there most mornings during the week, but tbh I can‘t remember the last time we went to bed at the same time. 

I was very depressed during this time for many reasons, mostly my job but also the lack of affection/attention I was receiving from my BF. However, about a year ago I was accepted into my dream school and we ended up moving again and I was able to quit the job that I hated so much and my mental health has improved some. 

With this move my boyfriend has been able to have a game room still in out new home and he is about the same as he was previously. He now has a gaming PC and I still go to bed alone and sometimes wake up alone still. I have never been taken on a date and I haven’t celebrated my birthday or anniversary really ever unless I have planned everything. 

Every time I talk to him about any of this he get angry and defensive. I don’t yell or get angry about it I just ask that he plans a date or plays a little less. He acts like I am guilt tripping him any time I mention how much he games. He says I am needy and demanding and I shouldn’t be bothered because he could be out at bars or something. 

In regards to lack of planning/dating he says he just doe not like going out and he does not like my friends, so he does not want to do anything involving them or really anything outside of the house. 

&#x200B;

Despite this, I do love him. I love him more than I can describe and he has been there for me throughout some of the most difficult times in my life. He also can be incredibly funny and fun to be around whenever he is not gaming.

I just don’t know what to do at this point....

I just need som advice on how to talk to him/convince him to address these problems and reduce his gaming. 

And any other advice if anyone has ever been in a similar situation."
1727,relationship_advice,Husband having (at least) an emotional affair with my best friend,"So this JUST happened. Me (35F) and my husband (35M) have been having a lot of difficulty in our marriage. It’s been going on for years and we’ve been in therapy off and on over that time, but my husband either doesn’t like the therapist or doesn’t put in any effort. I’ve told him I wanted out multiple times and meant it, but he keeps reeling me back in somehow with promises to change and work on things. I’ve told him time and time again, he doesn’t respect me and all I want is to feel loved, but he either can’t/won’t change. 

If I’m being honest, the only reason I’m still here is because of my kids. He’s going to get NASTY in the divorce and I don’t want to only see my kids half the time. I’m a SAHM and I can’t bear the thought of going from seeing them 24/7 to split custody. 

He just came in from a walk and jumped in the shower and left his Fitbit on the counter. It was going crazy! I know I shouldn’t have looked, but I did, and saw my best friend of 30 years sending texts and the last one was “wish I was jumping in there with you.” 

My stomach hit the floor. I’ve been confiding in her all along, and she just came for a visit with her two kids to play with my kids!!!!! 

I’m lost. What do I do? Do I confront him? Her? Leave things quiet and just start planning my out? Clearly, they can have each other. I would NEVER do that to my best friend. I’m just lost. I had even confided in her a few months back that I was sure he had found someone else and was interested, how could she come here and stare me right in the eye and have a play date while texting that crap to my husband? My whole body is shaking and I don’t know where to go from here. Any advice?

***************


Edit: Thanks everyone. I barely slept last night, but the good news is, I’ve had time to go over everything in my head and kind of get my feet under me, so to speak. I’ll be calling a lawyer today and starting the process of leaving him. I will also be calling the therapist for an emergency session. 

I’m going to try and keep things as downlow as I can with both of them. I’m not a good actor (though clearly they are!) so it’ll be hard to pretend nothing has changed, but I can only imagine that they think they are being so clever and sneaky so it won’t occur to them that I know if I seem a little off. 

I was in shock last night, but even in that state I took pictures of the Fitbit messages for future reference, though his phone is locked and I don’t know the code so I doubt I’m getting any more evidence than I already have. 

I’ve gotten some great advice in here and I’ll update when I can. Thank you again."
1728,relationship_advice,Fiancé blocks me and locks me out of the house when he is mad at me.,"32F, 37M. I have done a lot of internet researching and I can’t find anyone with the type of circumstances I’m in .

My ex fiancé and were together 5 years , engaged for 2. The last two years really strained relationship , and not because of the fun stuff like wedding planning . My mom had stage 4 colon cancer .. a rare aggressive type you can have genetically ) 
He would become very mean about and cold about everything , being upset with me for being too emotional. He would say a lot I need to “learn “ to control myself ... my mother is dying , you control yourself. Sorry . 

After the funeral came and went . He started blocking my number at 7pm until 3pm the next day . I only get home from work at 730, so the first time I assume his phone died and he locked everything up. Crashed with my neighbor for the night. He ended up admitting he was blocking me and locking me out to “teach me control and good behavior” he doubled down on me and he just started doing it almost everyday , using a text I sent to him he took out of context as his reasoning . 

He was NOT at all like this until my mother was in bad shape . He was the strong silent type , easy to get along with , sweet , fun ... like everything great to me I wanted to marry him when he was the person I knew!!! 

It almost seems to me (thinking back on it) I was in a vulnerable state and he used that to his advantage He makes several mentions that it’s his house and his property . We were planning on getting married so isn’t going to be both of ours soon??? 

I know this relationship being over is a blessing (we have been broken up now a year ) but readers please be aware that I lost my mother suddenly due to cancer , my uncle , my dads only brother committed suicide five days later which happened to be Father’s Day). I had my moms family , especially my dad and his family to help take of them after all the trauma . It was the roughest ever. On top of dealing with him . And wondering when he would get “mad” and fearing I wouldn’t have somewhere to go at anytime , causing another upheaval in my life .


This had  been going on for the last two years right after we got engaged . Since the break has been clean for about a year , Now I started back in the dating pool again. So much fun .. not 😂😂 
then I had two guys claim they don’t keep their notifications on  when they are “busy” 

So now this ends up being a trigger for me bc even when I wasn’t  doing anything wrong I was blocked and locked out . Why does this keep happening with different people ? Is it me?

TLDR : Is there something self confidence wise I can do to keep this from happening again? . It’s beginning to feel like a cycle I desperately want out of ."
1729,relationship_advice,"My(20m) girlfriend(19f) of 3.5 years makes me over explain myself during arguments, then tells me since I can’t explain my feelings don’t make sense or aren’t valid","So every time my girl friend and I have an issue, we communicate that to each other. At least we used to. She still does because I’m receptive of what she says and things change when she has an issue because it’s not hard for me to make changes to myself to see her happy. However I’ve stopped communicating my issues with her almost altogether because nothing ever changes. If she brings up an issue, I hear her out and immediately begin working on what she’d like to see from me. Some things come with time, some things come instantly, nothing has ever been too complex for me. If I bring up an issue, she projects her insecurities on me instantly and basically tells me that’s just how I am, but in addition to this she asks a plethora of questions which she says is her way of learning. I’m like cool she’s honestly concerned if she wants to learn more about how I feel, but she asks so many questions like almost too many, and the questions are often so deep and contrived she loses the main point of my issue. I have always been short on words, I really only say what is necessary nothing more nothing less. But with her, it’s like I can never do enough explaining for her. She likes to poke holes everywhere in my side of things, and after doing this she tells me “if you can’t explain yourself how should I be able to understand you?” For example, I asked her to work on her sex appeal with me (i have been losing sexual interest with her for a while because I am the only one that knows how to initiate sex, I like someone who can take the lead sexually occasionally I hate being dominant constantly because I get bored with doing the same things), and she began with projecting her own insecurities on me. After she says what do you mean, I say do things more sexy, she says how do I do that, I say be more sexually flirtatious both verbally and physically, then went on deeper to say verbally act dominant like you want to be in control or want me to do this or that, and act physically inviting sexually that makes me want to have sex by using your hands and body and facial expressions things like that. I’ll leave the other minute details out for the sake of the length of this post, but I dove more into detail in our conversation per her request, and it still wasn’t enough. She ended up telling me well if you can’t explain to me what you want to see, I’m not going to try to make any changes because I don’t know what you want, even after me explaining it. I need help, because I feel like she’s taking a long, drawn out approach to belittling and disregarding my feelings. This has been severely emotionally draining for me and I’m really on my last leg.

So a bit about ourselves, I graduated from a top 10 Public University, and I work at a great architecture firm in NYC, as a senior project architect. Because I know people will ask I make in total 135k a year. My girlfriend works as a software developer she went to a decent state school and works at a tech company as an engineer.

&#x200B;

When we go out for dates, in the beginning, I used to pay all the time, now we do closer to 60:40. When it comes to salary, she specifically asked, I don't like to have that conversation but hey I thought, if we are going to one day be married than its important to know. When I told her, she got a bit shy about sharing hers, but I didn't mind. And my girlfriend prides herself on being a feminist so I didn't think anything of it. I thought she was worried she was going to embarrass me but I didn't care. 

&#x200B;

This is how things went down, I was in the living room working out, and she was on the phone with her sister. I was doing pushups and wasn't paying attention but it went like this.  Her sister was going to leave DC to come to NYC, and she was like oh don't want to come to NYC. That dating here is a hellhole, this is when I started listening, and she said that she has to date down. She said ""my name"" is a sweet guy, but he doesn't do that well, he ""only makes 130k I am surprised he wasn't living with roommates.."" She went into other parts and then mentioned this isn't what she envisioned with life. 

&#x200B;

After she got off the phone I confronted her. First of all she gets angry for me saying that she deserves privacy. And I told her that was bs, that she talks about being open so let's talk. This thing is massively summarized we talked for over 6 hours and resulted in me leaving for my cousin's apartment. 

&#x200B;

Long story short: she told me that she loved me is happy with me. She then says its just that if I am going to judge you by 'societal norms' that we all know is out there that I am not doing that well. I got angry about all of this. I told her that I am doing great in my field, that her field pays more but that doesn't make her better than me. And that my title is much higher than her's that I actually manage a team of 10. 

&#x200B;

She starts going off on how computer science brings in a lot more talented people. But it doesn't matter that she doesn't want to have this conversation because it's hurting my male EGO. 

I got angry and told her that my EGO is just fine, that being talked down to is fucked up. This leads to more back and forth. And then if she wants to compare me by 'societal standards for men', then I will compare her to societal standards for 'women.' That she isn't a catch by any means that does anyone really want a 30+ year old girlfriend. She starts crying and insulting me more. Says that ""she gave me a shot"" and that I treat her like this? 

&#x200B;

I got even angrier and after this I just left. I don't know what to say. I am okay with dating a woman that makes more than me. Really I don't mind. But I hate that she thinks she is smarter/dating down being with me? That's messed up. Also too in our conversation she compared me to some of her ex's that had more money than me. And I can understand that if a girl is used to a guy paying for everything it can be a bit change of pace. I get that, look, I wish I made enough to where I could pay the bill without blinking. I wish I could. And I hope to one day. But the catch is these guys didn't even date date her. They hooked up a couple of times and they might have taken her to a couple of fancy restaurants. They weren't official. 

&#x200B;

I am sorry if this came off ranty. This fight happened yesterday. I am still in my cousin's apartment. My girlfriend has called me a couple of times and I haven't picked up. I don't know what to do. I feel like even if she does apologize, intrinsically she might just believe that I am inferior and she has to 'settle.' She might just say some things to stroke my ego and that's it. 

&#x200B;

At this point is this relationship basically dead? Is it even worth salvaging at this point? I know I said some mean things too, and if she was to apologize I would as well. I don't want to put anyone down, but at the same time the thought that she was being snobbish and looking down on me for my financial situation just really irks me. What do you guys suggest I do?

&#x200B;

**Tl;Dr- my girlfriend and I had a fight about money. She was talking to her younger sister about dating and basically said that she is dating down being with me because she makes more money than me. We got into a really big fight and now I am at my cousin's apartment.**"
1731,relationship_advice,Dad threw a plate at my face.,"Hello,
My name is Stephen I'm 15 years old and my dad threw a plate at my face. My dad has been agressive before but has never caused any damage close to this. So my dad was setting up the table and asked me to watch the food. The potatoes started over cooking and my dad got mad because of this and proceeded to throw the plate at my face hitting me just above the eye causing me to pass out. I woke up today with a massive headache and my eye swollen like crazy (picture on my profile). I'm just really wanting some advice on how to proceed I unvoluntarily flinch now every time my dad moves his hand and he is laughing at me now. He hasn't even apologised.

It’s not that I don’t want one but I’m very introverted, and don’t really think I’m that attractive. My parents have never seen this as an issue, but recently they seem to be taking an interest in my non-existent love live. My parents have hinted in the past that they believe I’m gay, (which I’m not) but as time goes on they are beginning to believe that there is something I’m hiding about my sexuality. I have dealt with this before, but recently my sister told me that my parents are talking about arranging a marriage for me. This is not a common practice in my culture or family, and no one I know in our family or community has ever had an arranged marriage. I’m really hurt that they feel they have to resort to this. I don’t know how to talk to them without damaging our relationship.

Ps: I don’t want an arranged marriage and want them to not continue on this path."
1733,relationship_advice,Should I breakup with my boyfriend (M24) who told me he hoped I (24F) would die in a fire?,"My boyfriend and me (both 24) got into an argument the other day and I told him he was acting like an a-hole and acting like a dick (he was in my opinion)
So he retaliated and told me he hopes I die in a fire and said he wishes the absolute worse for me....

I think the death threat crossed the line for what is okay for an insult (he usually just says fuck you  or something)

I am trying to break up with him but he just says ""I didn't mean it it was just a widely used insult back in gaming days when I was 16""

Yet be never said that to me in the 8 months we were together....

What should I do? Should I breakip with him?

He says it's more of a sign that someone is taking good care of themselves (which ofc I do) and keeps telling that it is a huge turn off to see women with hair on their arms. I feel like I am not really accepted as I am. 
I would like to hear more opinions on this."
1735,relationship_advice,I found out that my [26/f] boyfriend [24/m] of two years asked one of our female friends for nudes but he wants to work things out,"I met my boyfriend two years ago right before he was about to move 9 hours away for medical school. I was skeptical about long distance being burned in the past but he told me he loved me and was all in.. We did long distance for one year which was hard but worth it. I moved to the same city about a year ago and things were going really well. He asked me to move in with him, which we just did last week. I was so happy. 

My boyfriend has a female friend that has always given me bad vibes. She had slept with other medical students who had significant others but promised me she saw my boyfriend like her brother. I can acknowledge that I have trust issues because I have been cheated on in the past. 

However, they were really good friends and I didn’t want to be the girlfriend that took away any of his relationships. He had agreed to not hang out with her one-on one so that seemed like a good compromise and didn’t seem upset at all with this arrangement. He talks about getting married, our future children, and life together all the time. I have always been confident in our relationship and that this was the person I would spend forever with. He is my best friend, is extremely supportive, thoughtful and loving, loves my family and his family loves me. 

A few days ago, I found out that he had asked the girl for “more nudes”. I felt betrayed and broken. He told me at the very beginning of long distance they were flirty and had one night where she sent him nudes. He swears nothing physical has ever happened between them and that they have “just been friends” ever since that.  I consider this cheating, especially since we have talked about my past and how hurt I was and how uneasy this girl makes me. 

He promises nothing is wrong in our relationship and that he's happy,  which I have a hard time believing but he says something is wrong with himself. He says that it is self sabotage and an unhealthy relationship with how he views sex. He’s cried, apologized profusely, and begged me to stay with him. He has told me that he promises he won’t be friends with her, talk to her, or be around her. He’s told me he will go to counseling and if I wanted he would do couples counseling. He told me I can go through his phone any time I feel uneasy. I just don’t want that type of relationship where I need to go through his phone. He says that he knows that nothing like this will ever happen again because he can’t stand the thought of losing me.

I was hoping for advice on how to navigate this or if anyone has gone through something like this before. If we are able to get through this, how do you start building trust again? What are ways to start building up my self-worth and self-confidence? He always builds me up and makes me feel great about myself but now I feel blah. Strategies to deal with my sadness? It has only been a few days but whenever I am not busy my mind starts to wander and think about it."
1736,relationship_advice,"My mom refuses to give me privacy, freedom, or my own independent life","First off, I want to mention that I’m 19 and the first and only daughter in my family. My mother used to be someone I could confide in and tell my mistakes and secrets to. She’s always tried to be a huge part of my life and understand everything that goes on in it. But now she’s become extremely invasive and refuses to give me any freedom or independence to make my own decisions. She tracks me constantly and always monitors the people I communicate with even when I’m away at college. She refuses to remove any apps that give her access to my location or the phone numbers I contact. That being said, despite being an adult who wants to break free of her grip, I can’t seem to escape her. I’ll always feel like I’m being watched or monitored by her because she somehow finds a way to pry and get private information about me in unexplainable ways. She’s always questioning things I do and even when I make a point to be open with her, she tries to dig deeper into areas which feel invasive. She gets mad and yells at me when I put my guard up and claims that I don’t love her because I want to be alone and don’t want to share everything about my life with her. How do I get her to understand that she doesn’t need to know every little detail about my life and that she isn’t going to have a say in how I choose to live my life?

1737,relationship_advice,My [30m] parents are forcing me and my SO [26f] to get married in a church or they wont recognize our union,"Hey all, as the title says my parents, who are super catholic, are forcing me and my SO to get married in a church. My SO and I have a vision of how we want that day to play out and it does not involve getting married in a church. I knew this would upset my parents the most. If I had a choice I would not do the church what so ever, I am not a practicing catholic nor are we religious in any sense of the word. To me this feels hypocritical and that I am doing something to please someone else when this should be a celebration of me and my SO.

When I told them we did not want to do the church, they got upset and said that if we go through with how we want our wedding they will not recognize our union until we are married in a church in front of god. Now I imagine most would say, whatever fuck them its your day, which I agree with. However, my family is extremely close and I am afraid this will only cause more tension between myself and my siblings as well once my parents begin to talk to them. 

They want to meet this weekend to talk face to face (while distancing) about this topic, my SO says we should compromise and tell them we will do the church after the wedding the following weekend. While I understand, I still believe that is hypocritical of us and if we were to do that we would have to spend close to 1,000 dollars for the church to hold a ceremony as well as take these BS classes that allow you to get married in a house of god called pre-cana. It doesnt sit well with me but I know if I dont do what they want it will likely sour our relationship. The thing is where do I draw the line? I have been a good son to them, I was never in trouble, I have a steady job and can support myself and my SO. I am getting really tired of having to always appease them for their reasons not of my own. 

TLDR: My Catholic parents are forcing me [30m] and my SO [26f] to get married in a church despite us not wanting to do that. They will not recognize us getting married unless."
1738,relationship_advice,[UPDATE] How do I tell my best friend that our relationship has to change now that she's dating someone?,"[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gn36jj/how_do_i_tell_my_best_friend_that_our/) got a fair bit of interest and some requests for an update, so here it is.


She cancelled last minute Saturday due to ""being sick"" (who knows if that's true or not), so as much as I hate doing things like this over the phone we had a conversation there. It basically went: ""Hey, we need to set some boundaries, I can't keep doing this back and forth quasi-relationship thing. We can still be friends, but I don't think we should hang out one on one anymore. From now on we should just be platonic friends, treat me exactly like you would any of your other friends and I'll do the same"". It didn't go over well. She started off pissed and then basically had a meltdown, sobbing about how much she loved me and how she couldn't live without me and how she was going to get in the car and drive to my house. I told her that was a bad idea and that we clearly needed some space. She's been blowing up my phone. I've been ignoring it. Who knows where things go from here, but my sense of relief is almost palpable. Not the way I wanted things to go down, but I'm feeling like I dodged a bullet here.


Who knows where things will go in the future, but this wasn't healthy for anyone involved and something had to change."
1739,relationship_advice,What cute/sweet/fun doodles should I draw for my wife in the mornings?,"My wife works out every morning at the same time like clockwork. I've been drawing her fun doodles or writing sweet notes on a Post-It and leaving it for her to find when she comes back inside. I want to do this for a very long time. I've been at it for a few weeks and usually come up with what I'll draw or write in the moment. I probably spend a couple minutes on it. I'd love to have a huge list of ideas to keep this up for a while. I'm sure I could come up with something every day, but I'd love to throw some positive light into this sub and see what you all can come up with too!

I've done little drawings of coffee, very awful renderings of the two of us high-fiving, puns, announcing it's ""Friyay"" on Fridays, hearts, quick jokes... Just silly stuff to make her smile at the start of her day. I've been using a bunch of multi-colored markers.

Any ideas?"
1740,relationship_advice,Should she be expected to cook and clean if I make all the money?,"Me and my GF have been together for just over 2 years. I currently am the only income for our household, and I make decent enough money to support our lifestyles. She doesnt really ask for much tbh, but my point is this.

I pay for all the bills, food, entertainment, everything.

But she is constantly fighting with me when I tell her I expect the house to be cleaned up, and for the dogs to be taken care of. But if she doesnt have a job, and isnt going to school right now, is that a lot to ask?

When she complains about it, I tell her that she can go get a job anytime, and I will split the cleaning etc.

Keep in mind, I work rediculous hours, and on my days off, I am more than willing to clean up, take care of the pups, etc while she gets to sleep in or whatever.

I just feel like she is ungrateful for all that I do for her, and it shouldnt be a huge deal to expect the house to be cleaned up a bit. It doesnt need to be perfect, just so I can see an effort or somthing.

&#x200B;

Secondly,

This girl is insanely jealous. I have never once done somthing to make her feel like she couldnt trust me. But for my birthday, I invited my friends to my party, which included 2 female coworkers. And she about ripped their arms off when greeting them, and continued to berate me for inviting them for weeks. I cant really go out without her, because I would feel bad for leaving her home by herself more than I do already, but I also want to hangout with friends. When I try to involve her, she gets mad at me for trying to ""Force Friendships"" Which im not trying to do, I'm trying to give her the oppertunity to make a friend or two because she doesnt leave the house.

Please dont just say ""Dump her"" or anything like that. If I wanted to dump her, I would have. But a majority of the time outside of the dumb arguments, she is an amazing person, and has alot of common interests with me.

Edit: from reading the comments I feel like I need to clarify things a bit to get to the bigger picture.

1. Yes she is a beautiful woman, but in the original comments, I was more joking of that being a focal point. Honestly looks are on the back of the bus for what matters to me. 

2. Aside from the issues she has, I love everything else about her. She is funny, and has a great personality. And there have been plenty of great times in our relationship.

3. I mean to clarify that its not like she does NOTHING. She wants to work, which I encourage. And im sure once the whole carona isolation ends and job availability is on the rise, she will be pursuing somthing she is interested in. But right now, as it stands, we had the conversation, and she agreed to cleaning and caring for the dogs while she isn't working. So I think it may have to do with a huge lack of motivation, or she's just being straight lazy. In either case, I have gently been trying to explain that with her agreement, that was the expectation for the roles between us. 

Its just more frustrating to me because if the roles were reversed and I was able to stay home and only had to clean up and take care of the dogs, it would be like a dream to me. It takes what? Maybe 2 hours of the day max? I dont think its an outrageous expectation at all."
1741,relationship_advice,GF [36] makes crack about my [38] music then explodes that I put on headphones.,"UPDATE: 

First of all, thanks for the support. Everybody's help here helped me make the decision to get the hell away from her. A lot of your comments really hit home, really insightful, so thank you.

Anyway, last night, she posted on Facebook a suicide threat. I saw the post, after hearing her shuffling around in the other room. I go into her room, there's empty bottles, pills, so I tell her she needs to go to the bathroom and try to throw up. She said ""just let me die."" I finally say I have to call 911. I didn't want to, but I had to. I gave her like twenty warnings that I was going to call 911, if she didn't try to throw up or do something to sober up. I gave her every warning, she did nothing, wouldn't budge. She finally said, ""I'm leaving then."" She did. She tried to hide. The cops came and eventually called in a helicopter! They were searching all over for her. They finally found her. 

I had recorded three hours of audio that evening and played it for them, just so it was clear what happened and she wouldn't be able to lie about me.

They took her to the hospital. She texted me tons of hate, calling me a ""snitch"", pissed I called 911, saying it was all my fault, saying how ""dare"" I put her in that position, because she suffered some abuse from cops 15 years ago. I didn't want to, but I had no choice. It would be negligent of me NOT to call 911. It looked like she took a mountain pills, and I believe she did.

Now you can imagine if I did not call 911, and she died or got severely injured, and I did nothing. Imagine what would be said of me. So I was in a rock and a hard place. I thought it was extremely low for her to bash me for calling 911, when it is her who put me in that position, with a Facebook post no less announcing she was taking 30 codeine pills and other stuff. She knew I would see it, I was on Facebook in the other room. 

She was at the hospital all day, **so I got my things and left our place. For good. I'm out, finally!** I could get out because she was at the hospital.

She ended up ok, she was not injured by the pills but she did take lot. 

She texted me demanding I pick her up from the hospital. I said the situation was toxic, she needs to focus on getting better, and basically that was it, and that I wouldn't be a part of it anymore. I didn't offer a definitive break up just enough to walk away. 

A barrage of hate and abuse ensued from her after that, calling me an abuser, awful, disgusting person, and I turned off the phone.

I'm not perfect but I didn't deserve this. Her suicide attempt seems to have been a way to just manipulate. I don't think she was serious, but just serious enough to use it all against me, no matter HOW I reacted (whether I did nothing, or did something, all designed to attack me, however I responded. If I did nothing, I would be called a monster for ""not caring"" or trying to save her life. If I call 911, now I'm a ""snitch"" and horrible for that). 

On the audio I recorded I asked WHY she was trying to kill herself and she said, ""You said you weren't invested in me three weeks ago! You said I wasn't family to you!"" 

So if that's ""abuse"" then whatever I give up. I got it on audio. Not that I beat her or cheat on her, not that I hit her, I verbally abuse her, no, none of that -- just that I said I wasn't happy basically. 

Anyway, it's over and I'm done, but I expect she will continue to harass me in any way she can. I'm exhausted. I just spent two years with an EXTREMELY vile, probably Narcissistic / BPD person and I need to try to recover, figure out why I let this happen (I did break up with her like 20 times, but figure out why I wouldn't leave for good), and hope she leaves me alone.

ORIGINAL POST:

I rarely play music I like (U2), but today I did, and when I turned it off my GF blurts out this mocking ""joke"" about how ""sad"" my music is, ""Oh god, ALL that is is SAD music, it's like 'Wah wah wah sad sad sad' oh my god, I could do an imitation of that and put online and people would laugh so hard!"" She was clearly sick of it.

Seemed like a needless, nasty crack, so I give her look, turn it off some other music I put on that she likes, and put on headphones.

This leads to an explosion.

I'm now ""abusive"". She claims she was ""trying to connect"" with me, and said she ""made a funny joke."" She says I hurt her by not laughing. She says I'm basically an idiot for ""not thinking it was funny, everyone would think I was funny."" 

She goes on to say ""you have no friends, you have no one"" and says ""this is why"" and says ""you came from a rich family."" Ok? 

I sit there and mostly just take it.

Later, I TRY to explain how it seemed rude, and just once again snaps and snarls at me.

I bring it up later and say, ""Ok so why did you bring up my rich parents? You know I never took money from them, I made my own way, and you yourself have a huge trust fund you live off of from your parents, so what's your point? Seems hypocritical.""

She snarls, ""If you don't know the point I was making, then F off.""

She later proclaims she is ""never wrong"" and goes on to call me a ""dumbass"".

Now she's been crying really loud for 30 minutes, after I said I don't feel like she's ""family"" or ""has my back"" at all.

She calls me an ""abuser"" constantly.

I don't think what I did was abuse at all. I felt she was rude, so I put on some headphones. That led to me being attacked harangued for 30 minutes. I try to address how I felt, and once again I'm just attacked over and over by her."
1742,relationship_advice,I have no interest in anything my mom talks about and it’s getting extremely annoying. What do I do?,"TLDR; My mom’s crafting hobby is all she talks about, and I’m finding it difficult to care/be invested in her conversations

My mom is one of those ladies who likes to make crafts. She has a bunch of paper cutting machines, miles and miles of ribbon, buttons, paper, etc. You name it, she has it.

She even converted our garage into her craft room so now we have to park on the street. Her room is overcrowded with things she never uses. Her hobby also takes over the living room, with whatever project she’s working on at the time claiming the dining room table or a couple foldable table trays near the couch.  Almost every day, she gets a new package in the mail, and pretty soon, there won’t be any space in her craft room left.

This is a hobby she’s had for almost 20 years, and she really is very good at making thoughtful cards, decorating planners, making little tags and paper dolls, stuff like that. But it’s all she talks about. She’s so excited because “oooh this print is so pretty” or “oooh I’m getting this new stamp set!”

I feel bad but there are times I could not give less of a shit about what kind of cheesecloth she’s using on her notebook cover page. I know she loves her hobby, and it’s just us two in the house, but I’m getting increasingly annoyed having to tip toe around her stuff all the time.

She knows I don’t share an interest in her hobby (despite YEARS of trying to get me to craft with her), but she can talk for what feels like hours and she’s so persistent about showing me stuff I just don’t care about. I’m not sure what to do because I’m beginning to resent talking to her and I feel bad hiding in my room all the time to avoid being pestered."
1743,relationship_advice,My brother gave my Disney+ password to his ex gf who I've never met without my permission.,"Hi guys. First time poster in this thread and I gather it's for all forms of relationships. I(27f) am really close to my brother(30m). We had to put up with a lot together and while we've always lived quite long distance and he gets up my nose with his political rants he's a fab bro and even better uncle. He got into the dating game quite late, as in in his 20s and so he still allows some women to run rings round him.

As soon as I got Disney+ I wanted to share the magic. I gave him access right away without hesitation. A few weeks ago we were catching up on the phone and he casually mentioned he'd given my details to his ex gf because she has 3 kids to entertain at home now and one is disabled. I was really surprised he did this because had it been the other way around he would have been really annoyed.

Now if I knew this girl at all, even met her just once I'd have been a bit more okay with it but I literally do not know the first thing about her. I was so take  aback I just said ""oh that's OK"" but it really wasn't. It's more the fact he didn't think to even ask me. She just batted her eyelashes so it seems and he handed her my stuff. He's also started to ask me to hand down my daughter's things such as some of her old dressing up. I live in a mini house so nothing at all except the most sentimental things get kept. It's putting me in an awkward position. I haven't said a word to him because I'm so scared we'll have a row. My husband and best mate have encouraged me to change passwords and such but he'll figure out why and again it'll start a row. Any advice appreciated."
1744,relationship_advice,Relationships lasting 5+ years: Do you really love someone that much?,"Ive heard when people say things like “when you walk into a room” or “i feel butterflies” and things like that.

Do you still feel giddy about the things they do? Are you still attracted to them? Are you still in love?

Here are some things to note about my girlfriend: A) I love her and she is the best partner I could ask for B) she’s a planner C) she has no clue what jewelry is nice and what is absolutely awful. 

Well since we discuss everything, we’ve been talking about getting engaged and she asked me to choose a ring I would like (I don’t wear jewelry, and I am really picky about what I like). No point in her buying an expensive ring that I’ll hate!! I chose a ring, she bought it, but she’s keeping the actual proposal a surprise. 

Everyone is acting like we’re not “doing things right” because it’s not a total surprise. I enjoyed communicating about things, but now everyone is making me feel like it’s not going to be a proper proposal because it isn’t a surprise. My best friend even went off on an (unsolicited) rant about how she would kill her boyfriend if he ever told her he was going to propose. 
I’m really upset and need validation!! 

TLDR: my girlfriend and I are getting engaged. We discussed it and I chose my own ring, but the actual proposal is a surprise. People are making me feel shitty because it’s “not a surprise”."
1747,relationship_advice,Can the first relationship be enough?,"Me (22) and my boyfriend (23) have been together for a little over a year now, and in general, everything is great. We have a lot in common, we have the same values and humor, we treat each other well, each of us gets along with the other ones family and friends and so there is nothing to complain about. 
The thing is, he is my first boyfriend and the first guy I've ever been in love with or even emotionally attached to, other than childish crushes. And lately I've just been feeling that, even though I am happy with him, I just dont know if it might not be even better with someone else, because i dont have anything to compare it to. I am not considering breaking up with him, and I dont think he would be ok with an open relationship, which i dont think would even help because it's not about the sex or anything. I just dont want to wonder if I am with the person I should be with or if changing something would make me happier, longterm.
So yeah, basically I'm just wondering if I should do anything about it,  talk to him about it or not, and if anyone who's been in the same situation has any advice."
1748,relationship_advice,I (F23) no longer enjoy having sex with my SO (M25) and I don’t know how to proceed,"I’m struggling to understand if this is a common problem in relationships and that I should aim to overcome this problem somehow or if in my case this is a legitimate sign of incompatibility.

For background, I have only had one relationship where I didn’t experience declining sexual desire for my partner towards the end of the relationship.

My current relationship is serious though it has its flaws and we talk about marriage but we’ve been together for 3 years and I expected to stop enjoying sex later down the road. 

Also, we do try to spice things up and my SO does ask me what I would want to try/do.

I’m just left with a lot of feelings of doubt and confusion..."
1749,relationship_advice,"At 23, should I just give up on monogamous relationships?","So I’m a recently graduated 23 year old guy. 

I’m getting a bit down on the dating scene. I wouldn’t say I’m particularly ugly or unsuccessful or anything. I dress well. I try my best. 

But what id really like is a monogamous relationship. No one my age seems to want it. I’ve had things that have gone on for 3 months. Sex, dates etc. But turns out they’ve been on tinder going on other dates for the whole time. Sleeping with other men. Not being honest about this. 

The last girl I really cared for. But she gaslighted me and did the same thing. Literally every girl in the city I live in (London) does the same. None of them want monogamy. 

It’s kinda getting me down. Does monogamy even exist anymore? Starting to think I should just give up on it."
1750,relationship_advice,Me (20F) my Best friend (21M) and my Boyfriend (22M). My Boyfriend doesn't want me being friends with my guy best friend and I have no idea how to handle the situation.,"Okay, I'm going to try and make this short but I need help. I have a best friend (we will call him Sam) when we were 15 we had a thing for maybe 2 weeks and we had done it once or twice. we stopped being friends after we broke up until a little over a year ago. we reconnected and are JUST FRIENDS. Now my boyfriend (we will call him Max) and I had just started dating when Sam had showed up again. I briefly explained to Max that we dated when I was 15 and it wasn't something to get worked up on. I left out us sleeping together for multiple reasons and it didn't become an issue that I did. They became friends quickly and even time to time hung out without me being there. Eventually like a year later Max figured out Sam and I had slept together and I didn't talk to him for over a month because Max didn't want me to have anything to do with him anymore. We argued a lot because of it and he almost left me. In that month or so Sam signed up for the military and called me to tell me that he was leaving in the next couple months for it. Of course I wanted to spend time before he was gone. I got the okay from Max and was able to see him for a few more weeks. I thought everything had calmed down and this wouldn't be an issue anymore but now Max is getting worked up about it again. Hes been going through my phone secretly to look through my conversations with Sam. who knows what else hes doing on there. (Side note: Sam has a girlfriend and is in the understanding of our friendship) Am I wrong for staying friends with Sam? Should I be listening to Max and have nothing to do with him? I have explained time and time again that we are just friends and hes like a brother to me. I honestly have no idea what to do. No one is helpful to me in this and I want some opinions about this"
1751,relationship_advice,I(24F) have some serious insecurity issues. Would it be better for me to work on them alone or together with someone more like me than with my current bf(28M)?,"Disclaimer: I understand my issues are my own and I should totally work on them, I'm currently trying and have made lots of progress 

Now onto my question, we've been dating for a bit over a year and we live together. He's honestly great, sweet, understanding, supportive etc. He has a very healthy outlook on life and relationships and we have a very similar way of showing affection (love cuddling for hours and spending time together as much as possible, have a great sex life etc). He's very supportive, compliments me every day, tries to make my life better in small ways and take away my workload and so much more. He's in short amazing.

But the thing is, he's very extroverted and friendly. He has hundreds of friends, he talks to a lot of people every day and a good chunk of those are women. It's not like he talks to them excessively or anything, but he does get texts from people and he does respond when I'm busy and we're not doing things together. Now, I'm very introverted. I have maybe 3 friends and I don't talk to anyone on a daily basis besides my parents. Literally sometimes a week can go by without me getting a text from someone. I try to be more outgoing and stuff, but it's a bit hard for me and usually I have a hard time since people who befriend me happen to have ulterior motives.

Anyway, I feel at the end of my rope here. At the beginning I used to love how outgoing my bf was, how much people seemed to like him and all of these things, but now I can't help but feeling sad. I see him text women or getting texts from women everyday and it makes me feel terrible. I know he isn't doing anything bad, but I just hate it. My exes had female friends, but like 2-3 and they didn't talk everyday and they definitely didn't get texts from whatever women every day. It just makes me feel so insecure and unpleasant. Every time I think of it I get physically sick. Even typing this out makes me feel unpleasant. 

He watches some females streamers and musicians and I just can't deal with it, like it's so unpleasant to walk into a room and be greeted by a half naked woman playing the guitar. He says he doesn't even look at them and I believe him because the tv is behind his monitors so he just likes the music, but it still feels terrible.

I know I should get over myself and deal with it, but lately in wondering if all the sadness is ok. Like maybe I'd be better off alone or dating someone like my exes who had female friends but weren't this outgoing and sociable. Maybe I just need someone closer to my own personality. Idk. 

I feel guilty thinking this because he's really great, but it just feels like I'm struggling too much sometimes."
1752,relationship_advice,My(24m) wife (24f) wants to take a break so she can figure out stuff but she has started texting her ex again.,"Honestly, never ever thought I would be making a post here, but here we are. 

Me and my wife have been married for 2 years and been dating for 4. The past year has been kinda rough  because we got a child, and she was a stay-at-home-mom and she figured out that wasn’t what she really wanted. So she asked me for some time apart to think about her life and I was heartbroken but understood and said it’s fine. She than started looking for some cheap place she could stay at for 1-2 months until she decided what she wants. Meanwhile she started acting very weird, switching her passwords on every device, started hiding her phone, and started lying a lot. I found out through a mutual friend she had contacted her ex for some advice, when I confronted her she denied it and lied about it until I showed her proof and she went “it was a one time thing”. Story goes on she still talks to him, denies it, and every time I bring it up she switches subject to that she just wants time apart and that she doesn’t feel good. So now I can’t trust her, I don’t even wanna talk to her right now so I just left the house and told her to be honest about her feelings when I’m back. 

So I guess I’m just wondering what do I do? Am I overreacting? Should I stop confronting her in this hard time and just trust her blind and hope for the best? 

English is not my first language, and thanks for any advice I get. I truly appreciate it."
1753,relationship_advice,Homophobic friend,"Basically long story short, one of my best and closest friends of 15 years turned out to be really homophobic. 

Now i'm a straight guy so one might think that this wouldn't affect me too badly but no. I completely disagree with him and his values and am utterly disgusted at the way he views lgbt people. Just the way he speaks about them is absolutely disgusting and there seems to be no changing his mind. Cutting him out of my life seems really horrible aswell tho, since we've been super close for 15 years and i dont really know how to handle this so any advice would be highly appreciated."
1754,relationship_advice,I booked a retreat and massage and it has turned into war -- and now I'm booking massages for my partner?,"&#x200B;

My partner had to be “on call” for his work Sunday through Wednesday of this week.  

So I found a retreat place about 20 minutes away that had opened up after COVID. I booked it — paid for it. I booked myself a couple of massages and I told him that if he wanted to sleep there, that would be great. But, no pressure.

Whatever he needed to do for work. 

He seemed taken back that I did this. ( I used MY money). I told him I wanted to relax and do something nice for myself and if he had a time to schedule something, I would include him in the massage and book it for him too.

So we have 2 dogs. I cleared that the dogs could come with me. He said that would be a “nightmare” and he said he would have one of his kids watch the dog. The oldest (25) said she would do it (so he told me). I said well, I want to make sure that she is really understands because the puppy needs attention. He’s about 6 months and getting good with house breaking so we need to be very watchful and keep it up. He said it would be fine.

So he showed up yesterday and said he wanted a massage. I booked it for him. He offered to pay but I haven’t accepted anything yet. I’m still here.

I went and got dinner while he got his massage. I also went to the grocery store and got him his favorite fruits that he likes to eat while watching TV>

He didn’t say much. He kind of complained about the place, but once or twice said it was nice. He did say — I don’t know why you needed to come here why not just stay at home where you have everything?  

I let it go. So we were watching a movie around 8 and he was texting his kids. I asked how the dogs are. He said that he was upset because his daughter backed out and now his SON and his gf were going to stay over night. I said what? That’s not good. They don’t know what to do — and why the change? 

He started screaming at me that it was none of my business and he would handle it. I said look, they are my dogs too and I deserve to know what’s going on.

He said his son would be staying there but his daughter would be there a 8am to check on them. I said that doesn’t make any sense? Why would she need to come at 8am if your son is already there?  

I offered to just drive and get the dogs. He screamed again at me and told me to stop asking questions and leave him alone. The screaming was so jarring I almost cried.  

Then he kept getting called all night for work and woke up at 6:45 and left to go into the office — and he was super loud. Turned on all the lights — banging around.

I thought WHY am I going through this? I am not very unsettled. I feel very off. I can’t seem to relax and I can’t even work because the wifi is bad. I want to go check on the dogs and he told me no. His kids are there and to leave them alone. To “just relax” 

How would you deal with this?  He will be coming back here in a couple of hours because I made sure to get him a massage during the time that I have one because he acted very strange and jealous."
1755,relationship_advice,I need advice about working in a male dominated field.,"This is going to be long, and I’m going to give full context. 

So I (23f) have been working in a male dominated field for about 3-4 years. We work 24 hour shifts (first responder). When I met my fiancé, he was working at the same job just higher up as me. He was separated but not fully divorced which was a whole situation in itself. We took it slow and now we’re here engaged and doing well. He was let go from the job for seeing me in the beginning. This has made the rumor mill VERY active for me which I’ve come to terms with for the most part. I’m a considerably attractive female and very fit (not trying to gas myself up, but it’s apparent) The problem I have is now 3 years later, I still deal with the wives. I’ve gotten countless messages and problems with their wives thinking I’m a threat to their marriage when I’m just trying to do my job. It puts me and my coworkers in an awkward spot. I’m tired of explaining myself and being the bad guy. I consider myself “one of the guys” but they don’t see it that way and it’s starting to affect my job. And people “can’t work with me at the same station because the wives won’t let it happen” Does anyone have any advice on what to do? It’s making me lose passion and I love my job but I’m worried I won’t have any people to rely on if something ever goes bad on the job."
1756,relationship_advice,My (M21) Ex best friend (M26) threatened to kill me but later on asked me to be his best man,"It’s too long of a story to post but I’m happy to answer any questions for context purposes.


We were best friends for over a year and a half at least and had our ups and downs as any friends do. But nearing the end he On several occasions threatened to kill me and even said he was going to do unspeakable things to me to his friends, all of it was on an alcohol and cocaine bender and I backed away because of that before the threats.


He has a history of violence and on 3 occasions has attacked me while under the influence of alcohol and some drugs, I’ve had to remind him a lot I’ve done so much for him but I couldn’t put up with it anymore. 

He of course made me look like the bad guy to his friends when all I really did was cancel his phone plan because he was a couple days late and did not want to deal with his bender anymore or him as a person,
Saying I’m not there for him in his biggest times of need.

3 months later he is telling me over Facebook he is getting better and not doing these drugs and wants me to be his best man to the girl he is supposedly engaged to.

And what do I want?: genuinely want him to get better and perhaps be friends with him but can’t risk it if it’s a trap or a complete lie because he does have a violent past towards men and women.

TLDR: violent Ex friend who threatened to kill me wants me to be his best man at his wedding and be friends again, I’ve been told by everyone that I’m better off without him due to our past, I would like to be his friend again if he stops drinking and doing drugs, how should I approach this?"
1757,relationship_advice,I(30/m) don't know what to do about my long term relationship with my gf (32/f),"I've been with my gf for about 10 years and she's a truly amazing and supportive person. They're always there for me and our friends and family just can't stop with the ""you're so lucky to have her"" kind of talk. This is the person I thought I wanted to be with for the rest of my life, but I have been having second thoughts and doubts and I feel like such an asshole because of this. Every time she brings up moving into a new house or getting married I just break down and cry. I feel so damn guilty for having these feelings of doubt and potentially wasting ten years of someones time. I'm afraid of talking with her about this because recently she talked about how she wouldn't be alive right now if it wasn't for me and I tried brushing it off saying she would have been fine, but she insisted it was only because of me. I'm really scared of mentioning anything and I feel so dead and broken on the inside. They didn't do anything wrong and I shouldn't be feeling like this. What the hell happened? Why do I feel so miserable?"
1758,relationship_advice,My mom (37f) thinks I (14f) blame her for my brutal beating.,"First-time poster. Sorry if I make any mistakes. I'm going to try to keep this as short as I can.

When I was about 5 or 6, I was severely beaten. I say ""about"" because I have no memory of the event. I only know it happened because a few months ago, I found photos of myself hidden at my grandma's house. The photos were very hard to look at. I think they avoided my face, but the entire rest of my body was covered in big ugly bruises. When I confronted my grandma with the pictures, all she said was I came back from my mom's house (my parents are divorced) looking like that and the photos were evidence if it happened again. I'm at my mom's house now and yesterday I told her about the pictures I found. I DIDN'T ACCUSE HER. I only repeated what my grandma told me and asked my mom if she knew what happened. But my mom got really angry at me and said if I believed she did that, she would no longer be my mom. Then she called my dad (I didn't hear what was said) and hasn't spoken to me since.

I guess I want to know if I should keep trying to find out what happened? Or if it's better I don't know. Everyone else seems okay forgetting it happened, maybe I should be too.

Edit: Thank you all for the advice and helpful comments. I read and appreciate them all, though there were some common questions.

My mom did have custody at the time. My dad got custody of me a couple years later. Like I said, I don't remember the event, but I remember almost nothing from before age 8. I thought this was normal but I guess not? If any other abuse that severe happened, I can't remember it either. And yes, it was 100% me in the photos. My dad's mom took them and she took them back from me when I confronted her. I am sure I will never be able to find them again. It could be either of them, I guess. I just didn't want to believe it was my mom despite her reaction because she's actually a pretty good mom otherwise.

I will take your advice to talk to a counselor. I don't trust anyone to tell me the truth now. Maybe I can try talking to my dad later. I will update if I find anything out."
1759,relationship_advice,"Eating dinner with my girlfriend and her family, what should I bring? [15M] [15F]",Should I bring food or something? We’re just gonna be eating pizza and watching a movie. I hear flowers are a good idea?
1760,relationship_advice,I (29f) am embarrassed to get off in front of parter (29m),Been together about a year and I have enjoyed our sex but I would really never fully get off. Recently we talked more about this and he has become more receptive to my needs. This weekend we used some toys that made me fully get off and he laughed at me while I was having an orgasm. It made me feel really embarrassed and also like me getting off isn’t really a priority during sex or that he doesn’t really enjoy sex with me. Am I being too sensitive?
1761,relationship_advice,I (17F) feel like I have met the love of my life (17M) too young and don’t know what to do,"So the guy (17M), I (17F) am talking to is one of the most amazing people I have ever met. We have known each other for three months and met at a ball three weeks or so before lockdown (UK timings). We went in a few dates beforehand and got on really well. We have kept in close contact throughout quarantine and met up while socially distancing a few day’s ago for a picnic. Leading up to it I was really nervous and couldn’t wait to see him but the moment I did, something just wasn’t 100%. He has never done anything wrong and makes me feel very loved. 

There is one major difference between us and that is that I am a very outgoing and extroverted person, while he is quite introverted and would happily be by himself for and extended period of time. This has never been a big problem despite what some people think. I really like him and cry whenever I think that he may not want to talk to me when I tell him how I feel. I think I am too young to date someone who I would marry I had met in the future. I’m not sure I want to date him now because I want whatever relationship we have to last a long time, but I feel I am too young to get into something so serious. 

My friend says that I am too good for him, should dump him and move on. My mother says that he will be amazing when we are older and that I have found him at the wrong time and in a few years I will want to date him more. Her friend says that as he is already so nice and respectful at this age that he will be an amazing husband when he gets older. 

I know that he cares for me, and I care for him. But I’m not sure I’m ready to be in a relationship with him yet, but I am terrified he will be annoyed by my feelings and will want to stop talking to me. What should I do next? Tell him I don’t want to date him? Friend zone him? Or do something else?

tldr: I have found someone amazing too young. 

Note: apologies for any grammar mistakes."
1762,relationship_advice,My (27M) wife (26F) have had a great relationship for 9 years but then 18months ago she lost her Grandfather and now she hates being around me.,"We used to be best friends for such a long time. Time together was cherished... Granted work pulled us to opposite sides of the country for large amounts of time, but as soon as we were back together everything was awesome. We hugged, kissed, did fun stuff. She could tell me everything and I her. 

But then her Grandfather died, he was an amazing man, and she really depended on him when growing up. But since he passed, she stopped wanting to be around me. If we were together she just wanted to be surrounded by friends instead. Sex just went out the window. Everything I said or did seemed to just make her upset or angry. 

Dont get me wrong, i was like, this is grief. So I tried to just let her cry. But then she found a friend (29M) who helped her through her grief or proved as a great distraction as he never knew her grandfather... He made her laugh. They became very tactile. Very huggy.

My wife has always been tactile, since when I knew her, so never has this been an issue. But since the grief took over, their friendship has blossomed, she is now antitactile with me. She hates it.

I tried to bring it up with her but she got angry and offended that a woman can't have a male friend. And since, she has stopped saying she loves me.

Not sure what to do as I feel all I've done is love her and support her and be understanding... I allowed the friendship to happen because I knew she was hurting and that he was helping, but now I feel out of the picture entirely... Over 10 years of history just to be replaced for being nice."

What if it’s really awkward (my social skills aren’t the most impressive). 

And then I’ll be focusing on if u can even keep up with them because they’re all super fit gym people (and I’m the opposite).

Please help :( I’ll take any advice"
1764,relationship_advice,My [27F] husband [26M] doesn't want to do anything with me,"I know we are in ""lockdown"" now but I've been trying to get him to come take a walk with the dog or take us to the park for more than 1 year and he never wants to go. I can't drive because I'm terrified of driving (he doesn't trust me because I'm not good enough so he can't teach me) so I can't just go somewhere when I want to. So I always rely on him to go anywhere, even to the grocery store and most of the time he complains about having to do that because it takes away from his gaming time. 

For months I've been asking him to go somewhere, to drive somewhere and watch the sunset, things that don't require interaction with anybody and I'm always met with a ""we'll go next week"" and next week never comes, because he's always tired and just wants to play video games. And he has told me before he doesn't like going out to do stuff with me so that sucks.

I feel like I'm his mom because chores never get done. I asked him to clean the litter box for 4 months and he only did it once because I threw a fit. He doesn't eat anything I make because he likes fast food better. He takes the bedroom trash out sometimes but mostly it's up to me to clean. I ask him to do dishes, he says later, and doesn't do them. I ask him to take the dog out, he doesn't do it. I'm exhausted. I used to have a high libido but he's so uninterested in sex my libido is nonexistent now and we only have sex when he wants to. On top of it all he keeps asking me to give him a baby. If he can't even take the dog out unless I get mad at him he would not take care of a child but he won't see that.

He is aware of the fact he has depression and he says he's bipolar but we live in the US and medical care is expensive. 

I just don't know how to deal with this anymore. I don't know why he married me if he wanted a wife just to be like a piece of art around the house to look at sometimes and say ""you're beautiful"" but never want anything to do with her besides that. I'm nothing but a roommate and a maid."
1765,relationship_advice,Torn,I was out of town and my wife was apparently seen with a man in the house. It was 1am and I later learnt she had gone to a house party she never told me she was going to. At this party was a guy she had asked her friends a few days earlier if she should fuck. She was very pushy about me not coming home a day earlier and told me not to phone her that night because she was taking TWO sleeping tablets when half a tablet knocks her out cold. The man I suspect also holds a grudge against me (I dated his sister-long story) and there's obviously no better way to get revenge. Do I believe the two people that saw a man in my house or my wife who admits to everything except bringing someone home?
1766,relationship_advice,Was I too hasty to break up with my BF for ignoring me after I had surgery?,"I'm 29F, he's 31M and we'd only been dating 3 months. We became close very quickly due to the pandemic, but were still trying not to rush the relationship. He struggles with anxiety and depression, and has been under a lot of pressure at work and school. He'd kinda retreat occasionally after spending a lot of time together, which I was okay with, as I need alone time myself.

It was becoming less frequent and we were really opening up to each other on a deeper level. Just last week he said he wanted to be a solid foundation in my life but that he needed that too.

I had a minor surgery not even a week ago, but it's left me in excruciating pain, had me throwing up blood and I almost passed out a couple times. I have no one to really help me so it had me really down. 

We hadn't talked for a few days before I had surgery and deep down I knew I wouldn't hear from him but I was really hoping he'd reach out. He didn't and I confronted him saying I was really disappointed he hadn't checked on me, and that he didn't seem ready for a relationship. He finally replied 2 days later saying ""I guess I'm not, it just stresses me out."" 

I feel like I made the right decision because his complete lack of empathy and making it about him is just appalling to me. I feel like even with the distance, a text asking how I'm doing should be expected. Part of me wants to try and work this out, but I feel like I'd be doing all the work."
1767,relationship_advice,Bf still talks to the girl he helped cheat,"I (24f) have been with my bf (27m) for 1.5 yrs now. 

After the end of his past long term relationship a couple of years ago, he helped one of his close friends (26f, let’s call her Sunny) cheat on her boyfriend (let’s call him Rob). 

So my bf and Sunny have been friends for a long time - almost 8 yrs. Sunny developed feeling for him and so did he and they ended up fucking around behind Rob’s back. So that was the main episode. Years down the line, my bf still talks to Sunny because
“She carries this burden for him” “she gave him so much but has to live with the guilt of cheating” “he is still her friend”. He seems to have OK reasoning (?)

But I just cannot seem to get past the fact that he seems to think cheating is ok. Of course - we have talked this through and have established that cheating is not ok and he agrees that the episode of cheating was a mistake etc. But I just cannot get past this incident and the fact that they still talk and Skype and be friendly and everything. It just really bothers me and I’m falling to put a finger on what it is that actually bothers me and describe it in words.

1769,relationship_advice,Friend [17M] threatening to harm himself if I [14F] don't talk with him,"I have been friends on and off with this guy for about a year and a half. We are just discord friends and at least in my eyes, we have never been great friends or anything more. He has always been a bit clingy but i recently unblocked after a few months of being blocked and he has just been so much more clingy.

Before I blocked him, he had a girl friend and we were just average friends. We talked every couple of days and mostly just hung out because we played video games together. But as time went on, he would just dump his problems on me, and just would kill my mood, all while I was going through some serious issues in my life. So finally I got fed up and just had to block him for my mental health.

About 2 weeks ago, I decided to give him another chance. When I friended him again, he immediately started talking with me and one of the first things he told me was that he was so sad and had tried killing himself 4 times in April. He knows that I also struggle with mental health issues and that they tend to upset me very easily but he just *has* to dump those issues on me. He also told me that he lost his girlfriend, has no friends anymore, etc. And seems to only talk to me and ask me how I am when he wants to talk about how bad his life is. Usually our conversations go, he asks me how I am, I say that I am good and ask him how he is, and then he just starts complaining about everything and how he has a horrible life and how he wants to hurt himself. Now this is quite concerning, so I gave him the suicide hotline number and told him that he can talk with them at any time of day and they can help him out. He tells me all the time that I am the only person left in his life and that if I leave him, that he will kill himself. Then again today, he had to come to me and talk about all his problems. I was already not in the mood to deal with someones issues and I had my status set to ""please dont dm me right now"" but he started to do the exact opposite of what I wanted anyone to do, he started to DM me. Then not only did he complain about everything under the sun, but he also started insuling my voice and looks. I got quite mad after this and told him that I will not be replying to his messages for the rest of the night. He then proceeded to message me about 5 times asking me to talk with him and hang out with him. Then I saw his status set to something about how I had betrayed him and his only lifeline had left him, or something along those lines.

Unsurprisingly, this has taken a toll on my already pretty bad mental health and I'd like to just break things off. But I am extremely worried that if I block him or tell him that I don't think being friends is the best right now, he will end up hurting himself and possibly ending his life. I also forgot to mention that his girlfriend left him for the same things he is doing to me and he already knows that he is too clingy and needy to people. Should I break this friendship off? Would is be safe? I just need some advice on what to do in this situation. (Sorry for my bad English)"
1770,relationship_advice,"I (22M) lost my Wife (21F) 11 months ago, I stopped talking to my friends due to the confusion I felt around her passing, I'm afraid I hurt them beyond forgiving.","**I don't have any family left, that's why I don't reference them to much in my posts, I was asked that about my last one.**

This June, the 10th, it'll be my wife's 22nd birthday. The more and more it edged closer to this date, I started feeling the fact that she wasn't here a lot worse, I think I numbed myself to her passing from the beginning, because I even started thinking about a present by accident. It started to hit really hard around 2 months ago. It was becoming crippling trying to keep up other relationships with the pain of losing her finally setting in hard, so I, probably my biggest mistake, disappeared on my friends without warning (phrasing it like that, because that is how I would see what I did if I was on the receiving end of what I did).

I didn't think... it was an honest but horrible screw up that is fully my responsibility, non of theirs. I just shut everything that connected me to everyone out of these woods off, and just slept or took care of my pets, ran on autopilot is what I'm trying to say. I haven't spoken to any of them in 2 months, I only recently decided to even turn any of my electronics back on. When I did, almost all of them had messaged me, many were worried, but the ones that relied on me to be there for them, who were also having rough times that I was trying to help them with. They got hurt severely like they rightfully should have. I know I'm the asshole in this situation, trust me I know.

I genuinely want to tell them I'm back, tell them I'm here for them once again, but I know I have broken a few trusts, and I know a few of them are very angry with me, rightfully, once again. I don't know how to come back, the stress I feel, the depression, all of it is clouding my mind, I need advice on how I could come back without causing anymore anger or resentment (I've also been worse socially my entire life than the common and normal introvert is... so I'm afraid that will screw me also)."
1771,relationship_advice,My bestfriend doesn't want to be my friend anymore because my lifestyle changed.,"My (25F) friend (27F) who I have been friends with for the past 14 years told me she doesn't want to be friends anymore due to the differences in our lifestyles. I noticed lately that my friend who I considered to be one of my close friends started to get more distanced and ignoring me so I asked her what was up and she told me that she didn't want to be friends anymore because she couldn't relate to me anymore and the significant differences in our lifestyles really bothered her. I was really shocked because all of my friends are different (both financially and personality wise) and I never knew a friendship to break up due to lifestyle differences. All of my bestfriends are from childhood so I am not gonna be the same person career/lifestyle wise as that is part of growing up. We became friends when we were 11 and 13.

To further explain lifestyle differences, I recently changed careers after college and came into a sum of money so I moved into a ""nicer"" home and travelled around the world for a bit with my spouse. My spouse and I own a company together so we are fortunate to have the ability to travel freely. My friend on the otherhand is still in school and is living on a college budget. Her boyfriend is in the same boat. I never talk about my new ""lavish riches"" (what she calls it) to her because I noticed awhile ago that she started to call my life ""lavish"" in a really condescending manner and I hate bragging in general because I grew up without much and am very very fortunate to live the way I do now. I always invite her to places and to my home for dinner (i'm a chef so I love hosting dinner parties) but she is a homebody so she will either deny or cancel at the last minute which I understand (she's been like this since the first day I met her so it is pretty normal). She always makes posts about how all of her friends are really ambitious and always striving to better themselves and that she refuses to be friends with anyone who is lazy and stagnant in their lifestyle.. yet she wants to stop being friends with me because she can't relate to my life anymore even though I worked hard to where I am today (worked 2 jobs and did school full time). She also recently told me that her boyfriend cried to her because he couldn't provide her what my boyfriend and I work hard to provide for ourselves (I know this hurt her a lot and is probably a factor in why she distanced herself from me). However, my spouse and I have been dating for 7 years and created a company during that time. She has been dating her spouse for less than a year.

 I am at a loss. I am heartbroken because she was one of my closest childhood friends who was supposed to be a bridesmaid at my wedding and don't know what to do. If we want to put finances into perspective since she is making a big deal about it, I grew up lower middle class and am now considered upper class. My friend is considered lower middle class. 

Tl;dr: One of my bestfriends dumped me because of the differences in our lifestyles."
1772,relationship_advice,My (20) dad (43m) doesn't know I'm transitioning while I'm still living with him,"Sorry if this is long or tmi but I'm looking for cis/straight people's input on this. Tldr at the bottom. 

I (20) live with my dad (~43M) and my sister (18F), and I recently started taking hormones. My dad does not know I'm trans. I'm sure in around six months though it will be somewhat obvious if not sooner. I'm also out at work, college, and with most of my friends so it's not a very well kept secret. I've told my sister about everything and I want to tell my dad too but I have some problems. 

First problem is that I don't think they will actually gender me correctly if I ask. I haven't asked my sister to because I don't really want to be outed by her. There's a difference between being accidentally misgendered and being intentionally misgendered and the latter feels much worse.

Second problem is most of my dad's side is very vocally homo/transphobic and I've never really had that sort of conversation with him but he certainly doesn't stop them. 

Third problem is that I don't want my mom (~41F) to know. She doesn't live with us since my parents separated a few years ago but I visit occasionally. I learned a while ago that I should not tell her things that she can use to hurt me. She doesn't seem to have an issue with lgbtq stuff and has been pressuring me to tell her why I'm so involved in lgbtq stuff but who knows when it's her kid. She also does this thing where she will tell tales about how impressed she was with herself when she did something and she will tell everyone. Over and over. If she counts being okay with me in that she will out me to everyone and probably without context or prelude. She bragged on Facebook about reassuring me while I was crying about the Pulse shooting and she didn't even reassure me. She just asked if there was a reason that a *shooting* upset me so much in a prying tone of voice and then I tried to calm myself down.

I want to tell my dad because being misgendered constantly isn't great for me and because I want him to know, but I don't want to put him in a position where he would have to keep secrets for me from my mom because she would absolutely take it personally and he is generally anxious. I guess I'm hoping for any input or advice. Hoping to cause as little relational fallout as possible (at least with my dad) when all this comes out. Pun intended.

**TLDR: I'm trans and my divorced parents don't know yet. I only want to tell one of them. How do I keep this from causing problems?**"
1773,relationship_advice,What to do about girlfriend who won't forgive family for nephew getting sick,"So we moved to our home about 7 months ago. It's about a 3 hour drive from our families. My brother and his family would come up about once a month or once every other month. They helped us move in. We have stayed with them at their house during hurricanes, they have always welcomed us into their home.

A couple of months ago they had come over. Our kids are young and around the same age. Their youngest got sick and threw up on our carpet. 
Apparently he was sick for a couple of days prior, didn't have any fevers,Boone else in their household caught anything. Other than him throwing up at night you wouldn't even know he was sick. 

My girlfriend was very offended by this. She said they should have left early (they were only staying two nights) 

The next day my daughter got sick and threw up and she proceeded to ban my family from visiting my house ever again in a group message. Saying that if they knew he was sick they should have never come. (They were told by their doctor that he was not contagious)

They apologized, even offered to get our carpets cleaned (my brother said that to me not to her because he was hurt by the way she was talking to them in the group message) 

It's been months, our daughter has a birthday coming up and my brother and his family are now banned from even coming to see her on her birthday. 
And whenever this comes up between me and her it just leads into a fight where she gets mad at me for siding with them and not ""supporting"" her even though I feel like she took it too far and know that she would not like people treating her that way if the shoe was on the other foot. 

I don't know what to do with here here. It's always a fight when it comes up. It never gets resolved. And the ones who suffer the most end up being the kids. 
Can someone please help me with how to go about rectifying this situation?

She says that she won't even consider it unless they apologized. But they already apologized twice but just because they said ""I'm sorry but she didn't get sick from their son because they were told he wasn't contagious"" she doesn't count it as an apology. 

Meanwhile her whole family is coming to visit on my daughter's birthday but only my parents are allowed to come. I only have 1 brother 1 neice and 1 nephew I can't imagine this division for the rest of our lives just because their kid got sick and threw up on our carpet 1 time

I am afraid that  I will fuck up our 5 year friendship if i continue on this path. I dont want her as my girlfriend I think. But the wants more than just sex. Help me out please .

TLDR: Should I fuck my best female friend of 5 years or not?"
1775,relationship_advice,I (20M) cant break up with my girlfriend (19F) even though i really want to,"So our entire relationship is a bit convoluted but ill try to give as much detail as possible. We moved into the same block at uni 2018 and didn't like each other and never spoke. We both stayed over during the xmas break in 2018 and got closer as friends. She then told me that she wanted to break up with her boyfriend at the time because she just didnt love him anymore. When the term started again, she asked me to smoke some weed and drink with her in her room. Things got a bit intimate and she said that she wanted to be friends with benefits. I originally said no, then later thought ""oh why not?"".  During this time i treated her as a friend, and because we had an open relationship, I spoke freely about wanting to see other girls and if i found other girls attractive too (like i would with my friends), however i always asked permission if she was okay with it. We then stopped the relationship over the summer because she said some fairly insensitive things about how great her financial situation is when compared to mine (my parents were facing bankruptcy and i owed her £670 for rent, which my parents didn't know about). I came back to her after summer because i wanted to be friends and realised that i had genuine feelings for her, she said she didn't have feelings for me but we started an intimate relationship again.

Over Xmas of 2019 we got into an argument, when we came back to uni we were talking in bed and said that she wanted to see my instagram likes (what i like on instagram). I showed her and she blew up on me and started to have a panic attack because i had liked a picture of a fitness model over the x-mas break ( I am really into the gym and follow lots of female and male fitness ""influencers"")  and she had a panic attack over this.I told her that i wouldn't do it again and then unfollowed all of the female influencers on my account. She then said that her trust in me had been broken and i had to work extra hard to get it back, which i did. I told my friends and about a week or so later i broke-up with her because I believed, with the advice of my friends that she was being over-controlling by choosing who i could and couldn't follow on insta. She then sent me a text thread while i was on my way to work saying how i promised to be with her forever and how we had our  whole lives planned out together and that i've broken her heart so many times that it's not fair for me to leave. I started to remember how happy i was when i made those promises to her and said that we could talk things out and we got back together. But our relatiosnhip did not improve, i just had to change because i was in the wrong. When our morals collided over small things, like if men should be allowed to walk around with their shirts off in public she told me how terrible my morals were and wouldn't stop crying until i admitted i was wrong. anything that i did that annoyed her i stopped doing even down to sighing over mild inconveniences. She then started to blame me for her insecurities, and i tried to reassure her otherwise. Then Covid happened, she went back to Belgium (her home country ) and i went to my home in the UK. I realised while i was back in the UK that i wasn't happy in the relationship because i had become someone that i didn't recognise. I thought that i may just be feeling this way because we were apart so i left it but with a lot of other stresses in my life i just became a little depressed and numb to everything. She then had called me while i was playing video games with my cousin and when i picked up she was already having a panic attack and said things like 'how dare you?' before even telling me what was wrong. What was wrong is that a flatmate from my first year in Uni, while me and my GF were friends with benefits followed me on insta, i had liked a post of hers where she is in a bikini in front of a mirror. This is a girl that i said to her i was attracted to while we were friends with benefits, but i hadn't seen since i moved out of dorms. My GF said to me that i cheated on her and that it was over. We got in to a very heated argument and i said some very mean words and we ended it. she then kept texting me paragraphs over the next two days saying that she was heartbroken and telling me how i've destroyed her confidence and that she wants to 'stop existing'. We had a conversation about how the relationship has become toxic because of both of us and that it was best to end it. She then told me that she wanted to meet in our Uni town so that we could talk it out and again i was reminded about how happy our relationship was at the start and agreed.

I know that i neither of us is perfect in this relationship, but she has taken back everything she said about us both being in the wrong and put the blame back on me. Every time she gets upset, I have to console her for hours even if i think shes in the wrong because otherwise she says that i am 'gas-lighting' , being 'emotionally abusive' and that 'it is not fair' for me to get to walk away without being heartbroken. Now i'm here and i know that i want to break up with her, but she has a panic attack every time i bring up the idea of me leaving our Uni town. She blames me everyday that i ruined her confidence by cheating on her ( through liking other girls pictures on insta) and that she wants to die. I don't know how to break up with her and just leave because it is heartbreaking to see her panic attacks when I'm trying to pack my stuff and leave the house.  My friends tell me that i need to leave because of how toxic the environment is but i can't. I honestly don't know what to do and feel trapped in a relationship with someone i don't love yet it feels cruel for me to stay because i don't love her. Has anybody gone through anything similar in their relationships and can help me leave?"
1776,relationship_advice,Is it ever ok to tell your friend she has a BO problem?,"Long story short my friend has had BO issues for as long as I remember. It’s her natural scent, we’ve had sleepovers and she still has that scent right after getting out of the shower. We’re really close but have only known each other for 2 years. 

Me and my friends gave her perfume (and some other stuff) as a gift for her birthday, but found out after that she never used it cause her mom thinks the scent doesn’t suit her (we bought a marc jacobs daisy perfume)

Anw I’m not really bothered by it, but was wondering if I should let her know? I dunno how to bring it up without hurting her feelings. Obviously you can’t smell your own odor, so it might be possible she doesn’t know, hence why she’s not using deodorant etc. I’ve heard a couple of guys she went on a date with say they would’ve liked her if not for her BO. (I wouldn’t want her to date people who says that about her anyways, but that’s not the point here.)

TLDR: my friend has BO and I dunno if I should mention it or just pretend nothing’s wrong. If I do tell her, how do I tell her without hurting her feelings?"
1777,relationship_advice,"Boyfriend being critical of me, am I wrong for yelling at him?","My boyfriend and I have been dating for a year now and the past few months haven't been so great as we argue a lot. I have a mild cognitive disability that makes me really forgetful sometimes and I understand that this can be frustrating and hard to deal with. Last night we were getting ready to leave his house and I forgot whether or not he wanted me to leave his bedroom door open. We usually leave it open if his cat is in there, and closed if she's not. I put my hand on the knob, looking at him, waiting for him to tell me whether he wanted it closed or not. He looked at me with a shocked and frustrated look on his face that I didn't know what to do in the moment. He talked about this for about 3 minutes straight, the time it takes to get to my house. His words consisted of ""We leave the door the same exact way for the entire time we've been dating...and you just stand there with this oblivious look on your face"" I'm extremely sensitive when it comes to comments relating to my intelligence, so I was hurt. I told him to ""shut the f up!"" He called me a bitch. I said, "" Stop treating like I'm stupid!"" And he said ""stop doing stupid shit, then"" Am I wrong for yelling at him?"
1778,relationship_advice,My partner (35m) of five years has never dated anyone older than 21 or been in a long term relationship outside of myself. Are those red flags?,"Hi so I am a 23f who has been dating my partner, a 35m for five years now and I haven’t been exactly happy in our relationship for the past few months. Of course I did the dumb girlfriend thing and began to overthink things and that’s where it kind of went downhill. I began to piece things together and realized that in all his relationships, his SOs were never older than 21. He has dated about five-six women since high school and two were while he was in high school so yes they were under 21 but after high school he was the guy going after the high school freshmen and having mental breakdowns over them. One of the girls was a young, work acquaintance, another a young childhood friend, and the last was a childhood friend’s little sister. The others were I believe just high school girls going to college parties. This went on until he was about 27-28 and he took a break from women but still flirted with younger girls. None of the five (the sixth girl I cannot quite remember may have been 22-23) relationships lasted more than a year. When he was 30, he met me and we began dating. He has slightly shit talked his former exes but also like...they were under 21. People under 21 in general are immature. I don’t know if he has ever stopped to realize that. 

Looking at it now...it kind of seems like a red flag? The “never been in a long term relationship” I could maybe sideswipe because there are plenty of people who are older than 25 and have never been in a long term relationship, but the ages of his SOs? I may be overthinking it because I’m unhappy with him right now but it comes across in hindsight as a bit predatory. Am I being paranoid?

Edit:
Also when we began dating I had to tell him to stop communicating with one of his online friends that he had been talking to for about 4 years. She was 19. The age at which he began talking to her made me uncomfortable and I told him that. He threw a fit and said I was being overly possessive and didn’t see what was wrong with him having female friends. He finally agreed and texted her goodbye, saying I had told him it wasn’t okay to talk to her and she just never responded and blocked him lol.

1779,relationship_advice,Emotional cheating?,"I feel so stupid and I don’t even know why.  At least not yet. I’ve been married now for 2 years. I thought this guy was perfect, we bought had left previous marriages where the other person cheated. He has been my biggest support and my best friend. 

Today, he went to work. I’m still homeschooling. One of our daughters (I say our, bc we have a blended family. He brought 3, I brought in 2) had to use his laptop, which he knows. I signed her in, and she went to get on her gmail account except his was still logged on. She gives it to me, and I notice it’s on his email and that says someone logged onto his Snapchat - which is weird bc he supposedly hates Snapchat and doesn’t have on. I confirm that it’s from his phone, and that piques my interest. I go onto his email and I found some from not too long ago where he’s emailing an ex. It was nauseating. A lot of reminiscing of past times, what they did, saying they missed each other. The last email was from November of 2019, but his trash box is surprisingly empty. She specifically asked if he was married and he said no. I don’t know what to do. I’ll add that I know they haven’t met up bc she lives out of the country. 

I just don’t even know how to confront him or bring this up."

1781,relationship_advice,An online friend asked me (18F) to see his nudes and my boyfriend (19M) told me to block him immediately,"Okay, I know the title sounds like an obvious red flag in regards to my online friend, but I need a little help because I'm confused about this whole ordeal.

For a little background, when I was 14, I had an issue where I was stalked by a person from my school and nowadays my bf can never forget about that and still holds a grudge to the guy. Now, 4 years later I joined an animal crossing discord server because why not. In this server there was section called #selfies, where the members could post their selfies just for fun. Usually, I tend to be a very polite person and give encouragement when other people post theirs.

Now, this guy posted his selfie and I reacted with some hearts as a friendly gesture, seeing that 5 others had done the exact same thing. He then private messaged me the next day and invited me to his discord server. I joined because, again why not, and we started talking. He's really nice, we share jokes and memes and stuff, but I don't really know him that well, nor does he know me.

This is where it got weird.

(No idea how to post a picture as this is my first post on here so I'll just copy-paste the conversation here)

OF: Online friendMe: Guess who

OF: spring can i tell you somethin a lil personal? im a lil curious on it but at the same time im not if i should be since this aint somethin i would do on the regular.Me: Go ahead, I won't judgeOF: its also a bit NSFW so if you dont want to know, its all goodMe: Don't worry about it, just tell meOF: alright. so basically i want to ask you is that can i show you a nude i took of myself? in my opinion, i think it looks decent. though i want someone elses opinion on it for my curiousity's sake. smh my head idk why im askin you this. but yeah just somethin between us twoMe: I'm sorry but I can't do that, I don't think my boyfriend would be too happy about thisOF: oh no its completely fine, my fault for asking

I had been telling my boyfriend how I was talking to my OF and how he was cool, but then my boyfriend started telling me that it was weird how he suddenly began messaging me as soon as I sent the heart reaction. He also told me he was probably ""simping about me"" and that I should be careful. Well, right when he said that the conversation below happened so I told my bf and sent him a screenshot.

My bf immediately began ranting about how guys on the internet are dicks and that he knew that would happen all along. I honestly was quite stunned because I didn't expect that. I've talked to plenty of people on the internet and am obviously very careful about who I talk to and stuff, but I didn't want to believe that my OF was just another ""nice guy"". My boyfriend eventually told me I should block him and leave his server but I told him I was unsure because after that conversation, OF just dropped it and began talking about animal crossing again.

My question is, should I follow my boyfriend's advice and block my OF? We haven't really talked that much to be considered besties so I don't really mind, but should I really just drop him completely? I wanted to give him a second chance, but my bf told me that it was up to me to decide. I really appreciate any advice. Maybe I am in the wrong here for kind of defending my OF, but I need to know without sugarcoating.

TL;DR: An OF asked me to see his nudes to see if they were ok and my boyfriend told me to block him and stop contacting him completely.

EDIT: I talked to my boyfriend about this and I ended up blocking the guy and leaving the server. I did feel like I was being too nice to the guy so I'm glad that's sorted out now. Thank you all for your advice :)"
1782,relationship_advice,"Boyfriend's cousin called my people ni**ers for the sake of a joke. His wife called me sensitive and they made themselves the victims when confronted. 1st interracial relationship, I'm in desperate need of advice.","I'm(F23) black and my boyfriend, who we'll call Julian, is Hispanic. We've been together for a little over 2 years. So there's my boyfriend's cousins, we'll call them Carmen(blood cousin) and Lu. They're together and we usually have fun whenever they invite us over their place. But I've never been a fan of Lu.

Occasionally, Lu will say n*gga this or n*gga that, and its always made me uncomfortable. I'll tell him to cut that mess out, and I'm usually met with a ""oh shit my bad"". But lately, I had been telling him it's not okay and being met with excuses or reasons why in that moment for whatever 'context', that it was okay. This has obviously annoyed me, but what happens next shook me to my core. 

About 3 weeks ago we were at a small cook out at Julian's(M24) parent's house. Julian was at the grill, and I was sitting out on the patio at a table with Carmen(F30), Lu(M32), Carmen's younger sister(F20) who we'll call Sandra who fortunately gets me, and Julian's parents who are not too fond of English but definitely get by. I'm sitting there on my phone waiting for food and was verbally molly whopped by a drunk Lu across the table who said the following: ""yo my dog is like a fuckin ni**er, he loves fried chicken and watermelon and weed. He's on that ni**er shit. *insert obnoxious laugh as no one laughs with him* I know you get what I'm saying, huh, Sandra?"" (because sandra has predominantly dated black men in the past and her current boyfriend is black). He just kept running with the ni**er jokes!! My head was spinning!

When I tell y'all that my head snapped the whole hell up...I was absolutely taken aback. Sandra immediately said ""hey Lu stop that, that's not cool"" and he shrugged her off and got up, went to Julian at the grill and started conversing. I looked around the table, expecting more reactions aside from Sandra's comment. His woman, Carmen was chilling, and his parents(who I give a pass to because they weren't following along with his conversation as it was in English) were in their own side conversation. I weighed my options then and there and realized that not only was I outnumbered, but going toe to toe about this with a drunk man that has a history of acting like a baby wasn't going to end how I wanted it to.

Julian went inside to grab food a few minutes later and that was when I followed him and told him about what happened. Come to find out, when Lu went to Julian at the grill, he was saying the exact same shit he said at the table, hoping for a positive reaction!! Julian started apologizing and telling me how he tried to correct and educate Lu at the grill and that made him very upset and caused him to storm off, which I did see they parted. I peeked outside and lo and behold, Lu was in the very back of the backyard, alone, drinking and visibly upset. 

This reaction was exactly what I was anticipating if I had said something, and probably worse because I wouldn't have been nearly as kind in my educating him. Not even 15 minutes later, Carmen is collecting her angry, drunk Lu and their kid and they went home. They left Sandra behind because she still wanted to enjoy the festivities. The rest of Julian's family were confused so he let them in on what happened and they were on my side immediately. Sandra started talking about how these types of things are common in Lu and Carmen's household and it honestly didn't surprise me. I was so, so very upset. 

The next day was WORSE. Carmen came over for mother's day, and I thought I'd be the bigger person and while my boyfriend and his brother were wishing her a happy mother's day, I decided to do the same, and she completely brushed me off. My boyfriend saw this and kind of gave me a ""yikes"" face. This, obviously, is when my attitude started. Right before she left, she confronted Julian and I, saying that she doesn't need to be stressed about this considering she was pregnant. Julian and I tried correcting her all throughout this pointless conversation. She started saying stupid things like ""I'm not trying to make it a he said/didn't say she said/didn't say thing"" yet proceeded to tell me that she didn't hear him say that at the table but maybe I did because my ""ears may be trained for that""... 

I tried telling her that her sister was there and heard it and reacted to it, and Carmen fought me on that by saying ""I'm not about to go around asking who said what."" So then you'll never get the truth?? Wtf???? THEN she was saying that she felt like I was stirring the pot by telling Julian about what Lu said rather than confronting Lu then and there, telling me ""You're a big girl, you should be able to speak up if you're offended."" Julian had texted Lu that night telling him he needs to apologize to me, to which Lu responded with ""why?"", and Julian texting Lu about it was stirring the pot to her...If I wanted to stir the damn pot, I would have said something after they left because they wouldn't be able to defend themselves. Instead, I went to Julian minutes after, seeking a sit down where Lu and I have a final 'heart to stupid heart'. But that didn't happen because Lu got pissy that Julian and I were upset at his horrific remarks.

I kept telling her that I was not about to go down that road with a drunk man that always gives me excuses and apologies for any amount of these transgressions towards me. She basically said it wasn't my place to go to Julian because they're family...which in my head was the exact reason why I SHOULD have went to Julian. That's his family, not mine. I shouldn't have to educate a grown ass man, CONTINUOUSLY, on how not to be disrespectful. 

Her ending notes were that I need thicker skin and each time it happens moving forward, let Lu know how I feel. But I'm not doing that. I'm not about to educate your man baby every time. It's idiotic. I personally didnt care to hear what Carmen had to say because my beef is with Lu, and my view is linear. After having to repeat my solid and sound counterarguments 3 times, I just let her talk. She wasn't trying to hear me, so I damn sure was not about to hear her. Her unintelligent take aside, what finally angered me was when I asked her how Lu felt(because I never cared about her feelings towards the matter as her argument was baseless and she's just 3rd partying the issue), she replied with ""I don't know."" A bold face lie. We all know as soon as they got in the car to leave, it was a conversation. It was a conversation when they got to the house too. You live with that man, don't sit up here and tell me you don't know how the fuck he feels when y'all obviously had a talk about it. Just say your man's a pussy that can't be held accountable for anything. The only reasons why I didn't bust her shit then and there was because she was pregnant and I also didn't want to have a terribly different image in the family. 

The following week there was another gathering, Julian's little brother's birthday, which I wanted to be there for him so I went. Lu avoided me, Carmen barely talked to me but tried to play friendly. Later in the night, I went inside to grab water and I saw Lu on the couch and Julian standing by the couch watching a UFC fight and sharing some light conversation and light laughter. That honestly pissed me off. It makes it seem like everything is okay and now I'm sure Lu thinks this is all swept under the rug because Julian doesn't have the same energy about it that I have, because I surely wouldn't be laughing and conversing with the person who offended my S/O of another race...

I'm in need of advice because if I have kids with Julian, I'll be damned if my mixed children have to be around Lu and Carmen at family functions(bc that will happen) knowing how much of a racist and racist apologists they are. I'm so turned off from his family gatherings now. Julian said we should keep our distance from them, but they're his family, I have a feeling that won't last forever, it can't. Carmen will have a baby shower soon and I know Julian will go and be buddy buddy with the two of them. He was apologetic about the whole thing, yet my feelings still feel invalidated and I'm worried about the future here because things have now changed forever. I'll never forgive them for what happened and how they handled it. They're around and about all the time with family gatherings, and I'll hate being in their presence. I also feel like I can't talk to Julian about it anymore because it's been 3 weeks and it may feel like beating a dead horse. I'm still so hurt though...this is my first interracial relationship and it's left such a bad taste in my mouth. I love him and want to be with him, though....please, thoughts? Experiences? Anything, please..

1783,relationship_advice,ive seen my (21M) younger brother (15M) cry multiple times in the past two weeks; not sure what to do,"i have a younger brother, Zach, who is 15. Zach is normally a happy guy, always laughing, smiling and telling jokes. the past month or so he's been quieter than usual, but i've figured he was just bored in the house. 

these past two weeks however i've seen him crying multiple times. besides when he has physically injured himself I dont think I've seen him cry since he was 8. the first he said he had just watched a sad movie, which sounded reasonable. the next day it happened again, and he said it was a sad movie again. the third time it happened i went into his room to talk to him, and i asked him if he was ok - he promised he was. 

the fourth time was earlier today. when i went into his room and gave him a hug he started crying harder on my shoulder. i asked him whats wrong, and he doesn't explain. i told him he can talk to me about anything, and i'll be there to help him - if he's in any trouble or scared of something I'm going to have his back.

he didnt say what was bothering him, but eventually he calmed down. he begged me not tell anyone, not our other brother and definitely not our parents, that i had seen him upset. im not sure what to do, because im worried about him. i have no idea if he's scared of something, depressed, worried, or maybe being threatened - i just have no idea. and i also have no idea what do next. Zach has begged me not to tell anyone, but i'm worried that something serious could be going on, and he wont tell me what it is.

what should i do next, or how do i get him to open up?"
1784,relationship_advice,"My boyfriend is reluctant to give me the same pleasure I freely give him, what should I do?","I've (F18) been going out with my boyfriend (M20) for over a year now, and I've given him oral countless times and he's always eager when I want to pleasure him, but as soon as I ask him to reciprocate that, he's super reluctant and makes excuses. 

He says he doesn't want to go down on me because he's scared, but he won't tell me what he's scared of - I'm his first girlfriend so maybe he's scared of messing up? Or not enjoying it? Or it being gross? But it just seems kinda unfair or weird to me because he's my first boyfriend too and I've never done anything with anyone before him, yet I still try my best to pleasure him, even when I don't know what I'm doing or i don't enjoy it as much. 

Last night I kept asking him why he was so scared to just do it, because I wanted to know if it's anything I can help with or at least just put my mind to ease that it's not because I'm off-putting but maybe because it's plainly a personal issue. But then he said I was pressuring him into doing smth. So I apologised to him, because its not right to pressure him to do something he doesn't feel comfortable doing, but I just really wanted to know what's so awful about the idea of giving me pleasure in that way that he's so reluctant about it.

My intention was not to pressure him, but nonetheless that's how it came across and so I'm aware that I should at least approach the topic with him differently. But I don't know how to.

Any advice on how to have a productive and non-judgemental conversation with him about all of this?"
1785,relationship_advice,My(28F) husband(37M) is hiding money,"I was looking for tools in his truck and found $3400 in an envelope. Then other envelopes with maybe $500 each. He admitted that twice he transferred money to his friend's account so he could get cash I wouldn't know about. Total of $9000 that he admitted to. I have no way of knowing if there was more. When I confronted him, he played dumb at first, then said he did it because he had anxiety about admitting to me how much he spent to get his new business going. He said the crane for the boat that he told me was $300 was $3000. He went out of state to buy it, and there is a $300 charge to a construction company from that day and city on his account, so I dont know if I believe the $3000. This is not the first time he has lied to me. He always says that it's too difficult to deal with me when he tells me the truth and that I can't handle it. I honestly can't think of a situation where he confessed up front to something difficult, without me discovering it on my own. He led me to believe throughout this whole stay at home order that he was making no money and we could barely cover our bills. I transferred my own money to his account many times when he overdrafted. If we get divorced, I'm afraid of how it will affect me financially. I have many assets (two homes purchased by me before we were married, little debt). He owes a ton of money for his taxes and other debts, which I was trying to help him work out. I dont want to be stuck with his liabilities and have him get my assets if we get divorced. He already tried to manipulate me by saying he won't be around for our baby (im pregnant) if we get divorced because ""we'll be better off without him"". Will therapy help? He might be too manipulative to get anywhere."
1786,relationship_advice,"I(F) realized I've been neglecting the emotions of the guy(M) I'm with, so I told him ill be fixing it... SO I need to know what you think?","So, I'd like to ask for help! I've been apologizing for the stuff I've noticed I've been doing in the relationships the more I realize I'm doing the more I realize that: Oh shit I'm the bad guy! I don't know If me apologizing and making efforts to fix what I'm doing to my relationship is going to read over well with him. **I put the question in bold below if you don't want to read it fully because I do need your opinions.**

(You can skip this part as it only explains events that have  lead up to the question, but I thought this might be useful to reference  )so far I realized:I lie a lot to try and fix things for myself: \*\*I fixed this. I let him know--> I stopped lying and now try to be as honest as organically possible, besides the natural hyperbole. (First few months)\*\*I kept bringing up exes and flings I had before him, and during the time where we weren't together for a year: **I didn't do this out of malice or in a mean 'get in your head' way, it was usually during talks about what we liked in sensual situations, so I brought up the person associated with the sensation rather than the action--> I stopped after he told me he really hates to hear about them --> and then it hit me (Below)**

\*\*(THIS PART directly is what lead to the question)\*\*I recently realized: I overlook his emotions a lot of the time and of the stuff I do and say affects him...I took a recent event into consideration and thought to myself ""why was he acting like that? I'ts no big deal, I'm the girl so if it was actually anything I'd have been the one freaking out about what I did""  and then I was like ""well, he is a whole different human being so how would I know that its nothing to freak out about?  How about if he had done the same thing, how would I have felt""

I recognized immediately that I had overlooked his feelings and concerns over time.

\*\*!!!QUESTIONS!!!\*\*I just apologized to him over text because, 1. he's busy 2. he will be busy for two weeks and won't be able to make many calls. 3. because he is busy: he also cant come over as often.

I explained that I realized and I was sorry about how I've overlooked his emotions and opinions and thanked him for being patient with me as I am a selfish thinker and typically didn't consider how he felt.  I've worked on all other problems as soon as I realized them. (I plan to work on this as well)

My question is: **Do you think I made the right call about letting him know I finally get it? Or should I have not mentioned it and just made the move?** I wanted him to know that I was sorry and that I do care about it all.  **I'm asking YOU as a guy, would finally seeing that I get the emotions that you've been trying to tell me about, actually matter now? especially if I prove that I see them and work on showing you I do?**

TL;DR

I realized I've been neglecting the emotions of the guy I love and I let him know I see it and will be fixing it... Have I made the right call? will it be appreciated? Opinions needed. I need help and advice from guys to improve myself in this relationship."
1787,relationship_advice,am i having sex wrong? havent orgasmed once in my 3 year relationship...,"Hi! I’m 21 (f) my boyfriend (21) and I have been together for three years. Sex has been good but never GREAT we are frequent and adventurous but never have incorporated any toys. My friends were the ones to make me realise how strange it was but I genuinely thought it was normal that I have never finished...I’ve been close at times but nothing compared to the way I can orgasm myself through masturbation. Its really starting to stress my boyfriend out as he has always been a bit iffy about the fact he can’t make me cum. He took my virginity but I’m his 5th partner and those other 4 of his were one time hit it and quit its so hes very little experience in the female orgasm department. We have researched a lot and other than making me ‘comfortable’ in my surroundings there hasn’t been much else...HELP are we doing something wrong? Anyone any advice? I nearly wish I could’ve been with another guy before him to know if it is something we are missing but we change up positions, lots of foreplay and have a healthy amount of sexual tension/chemistry. I’m really unsure :( please help!"
1788,relationship_advice,I[22m] think I was sexually assaulted by my [23f]roommate,"So I have social anxiety and I’ve never really had a girlfriend and I find it hard to make new friends but when I met my roommate 6 months ago we vibed really well and decide to become roommates.

I finally felt comfortable enough to tell her I was a virgin and she was quite shocked, this was about a month ago. Ever since then she has been flirting with me and about two weeks ago she has been been touching and resting on my body a lot. So last night we where watching friends(who doesn’t love friends) and she started moving closer to me and I felt uncomfortable but didn’t say anything. Then out of the blue she put her hands down my pants hand started rubbing my dick. I froze and didn’t know what to do. I asked what she was doing and then she said “having fun”.  Then she unzipped my pants and spat on my dick and kept on stroking. During the whole time I felt so vulnerable but I didn’t have the guts to say no. I eventually came and she just giggled and said “you made a mess” and called me a “good boy”. Afterwards she just left the room. I felt very embarrassed and even started crying. 

Was it my fault for not saying anything?
Also moving out would screw both of us because I’m a failing photographer and she’s a failing actress and we are codependent on each.

Edit: maybe I overreacted I think I may have feelings for her but I’m too scared to get in a relationship or have sex because I haven’t done either"
1789,relationship_advice,Am I wrong to be upset?,"A few days ago I (f24) found a messaging app “telegram” on my boyfriend’s (m23) phone. I wasn’t snooping because up until now he never gave me a reason to ever doubt his loyalty. He was right beside me and was aware of me playing around on his phone. I saw this unknown app hidden away and when I opened it, he had numerous group chats with nudes of girls. They weren’t any girls that he knew (I think?) and I closed it quickly because I was in shock. It seemed like it was a pornographic thing. We’ve always been open about porn, I know he watches it and there’s been a few times we’ve even partaken together. I waited to confront him for an hour because I was trying to process everything. When I asked, he immediately apologized and said it was just for porn and that he had forgotten all about it. He immediately went to delete it to prove that it was of no significance. He told me to “not overthink” which kinda ticked me off. Of course I can’t help but do that when I find a secret messaging app? I was kinda upset  and needed space so I left, he didn’t try to stop me. 

After I left he texted me pretty angry. He said I was invading his privacy and he didn’t tell me because he was embarrassed of it. We’ve watched porn together so why would he think I’d be upset if has nothing to hide? Idk if he was sending any messages in response because I closed out too quick. He was also upset that I had waited to confront him. I just feel like he was coming at me when I don’t think I did anything wrong. Yes, I shouldn’t have been looking at his phone, but we never mind using each other’s phones. And I wasn’t going through it without his knowledge, he was sitting right next to me. 

After I got home, I went into crazy gf mode and read all up on telegram. Supposedly it’s really privacy centered so you can get messages to automatically erase and such. I don’t want to doubt him cause he really is a sweet guy, but now I can’t stop feeling like he has something to hide? Why was he using this secret app known for discrete messaging when he could search for porn online? I also read that it “self destructs” the app when it hasn’t been used for 6 months. He said he had forgotten about the app and hadn’t used it. But we’ve been dating for 10 months... 

So. Am I being crazy for being upset? Is it truly just a pornographic thing? People who have experience with it, does it really “self destruct” in 6 months? Is it innocent that he was using this app for porn? Why was he on a messaging app to receive these videos/pics when he can look it up online or on a subreddit? 

I’d really like to give him the benefit of the doubt.
Please help a confused girl out. Thank you ❤️





Since I can’t post pics, here’s a text (directly copied) that he sent me to help sum it up:

“
1. It’s private, but it’s something I just willingly bring up because it’s private. Most guys do that. 
2. You let yourself built up your narrative in your head for two hours before letting everything out last minute. 
3. It’s an app I downloaded last year and never use anymore. It got lost with my other social apps. 
4. Again it’s private, it’s fucking embarrassing. 
5. You act like I’m cheating when it’s just pornography. I would never cheat, not share nudes, talk to other girls.

I’ve been open and honest with you for the past 10 months, but what I keep private it’s between me and only me.

1790,relationship_advice,Should I (24M) ask for post-sex clarification with her (24F),"Soooo I'm on the spectrum, and because of this, simple seemingly innate things like managing relationships can be very difficult for me. My intuition is often just flat out wrong. I am trying to get better at the social dance, and would really appreciate any helpful opinions.

I met up with this girl yesterday (let's call her Amanda) I used to go to highschool with, and we went for a hike and from the get-go I could tell that she was gonna be DTF. All the basic signs were there (leaning into me, brushing up against me ""accidentally,"" etc.).  After several hours of hiking around one thing led to another and we ended up at my house having sex. Usually that's a pretty good indicator for me that there's at least potential for a relationship, but I kinda had a bomb dropped on me while dropping her off at her house and talking to her roommates the next day. Her one roommate made a joke about Amanda dating a lot of dudes and kinda being promiscuous, she just kinda laughed it off after hearing it. I think the roommate was kinda being a low-key bro, maybe he could tell I really liked her (which I do), and he didn't want me to get head over heels for her when she's got 4 dudes on speed dial. And there's nothing inherently wrong with her getting around, but I guess I felt like maybe there was something between us that could lead somewhere. And now I'm not sure. I still obviously like her, but I just don't want to have to compete for her affection. I'm insecure to begin with and just don't have it in me. So now I have all these questions.

&#x200B;

* Should she have clarified before having sex that if she was looking for a no strings attached type thing? I regret not asking her right before sex what she was looking for, but it felt like it'd be an unnecessary mood-killer, and I had only known her to be strictly monogamous.

&#x200B;

* Should I ask her now, after the fact, what she's looking for? This one seems risky, like too many ways to fuck it up, and I don't want to be seen as clingy or something. I mean we only have gone on one date. Is it too soon for these kinda straightforward questions?

&#x200B;

* Should I just let things fizzle out? She added me on FB, and I saw that every single time she makes a post, one dude in particular either likes, loves, or care (the heart shaped one lol) emojis the post. I don't want to be her silver medal... But I feel like that's where she could easily put me."
1791,relationship_advice,I’ve cheated or lied in every relationship,"I don’t know what it is about me.
And I don’t know if this info is relevant- I’m 22 years old, pursing my masters degree in a field I love. I’ve always been a flirt and a woman chaser. And unfortunately this has gotten me into some trouble with my relationships. Nobody likes being cheated on, and on the other hand, I don’t think anybody LIKES to cheat. I’ve been cheated on and I’ve cheated in the past. I’m not here to make excuses for myself but I need some outside input. 

I can’t figure out why I can’t stop myself from disrespecting my relationships. I just lost a woman I love dearly because of an encounter I had with another girl. Nothing sexual, no touching, but none the less, it broke my partners trust. And here I am in the same cycle again: every time I  have a good relationship in front of me I cheat or lie. Without fail, I either talk to other women from my past or go on online dating apps. 
I’m tired of being such a POS.  I can’t figure out how to change and this keeps happening. Every time I get caught, I regret what I did, and I feel terrible for putting my partner through pain. I don’t want to be like this anymore. I’m tired of having my relationships severely wounded because of my actions but I haven’t changed. Where should I look for help. Where do I turn to? I need to change for the sake of myself and my relationships."

I really don't know how to react to the news, i'm really sad about that. I just told her that I'll always love her no matter what... She wanted some alone time which I understand.. How can I help her ?

1794,relationship_advice,Can love die?,"So my girlfriend (21F) broke up with me (21M) a couple weeks ago because she said that she lost feelings over the quarantine

I told her that we should have a couple dates, because I think that it's mostly due to the separation and high level of stress and anxiety that she have right now.

She don't want to.

Everything was perfect before the quarantine, we had a deep emotional connection, shared things about our past that were never shared and really cared for each other.

I have a gut feeling that's telling me that if we had those dates, everything would be the same as before, but I already asked almost begging, but she said no.

I'm kinda lost.

Although I don't have any problem with the bachelor life, I really think that if we tried we could save this relationship, but I don't know how to convince her as she always reply with ""the feeling is dead"" no matter even though she confess that her family and general situation are worsening her mental health, even more as she can't go to therapy anymore.

I have never had a problem with my crotch but recently a tiny open sore developed on there and it burns like a b*tch. I feel dirty. I got tested and it was positive. He got tested and is negative. I was convinced it was a mixup cuz hes clean and hes the only guy I've ever been with sexually. No oral or anything from other guys. I was a virgin when we met. So how the hell did I get herpes? So he has no idea I might actually have it cuz we came to the conclusion that the test was dumb. But now with this first ever sore thing on there, I think I do have it. I feel defiled and dirty and useless. I dont want to infect him. I dont want to be infected. I enjoy the intimacy of raw intercourse. Being that connected with him. But now, I feel like a disease. What should I do?

Edit: thanks for the advice. This is the first outbreak I've ever had. Someone mentioned stress could trigger it. Well we've all been under some stress for obvious reasons so ya maybe that did it. I also tried a different medication that I'm still recovering from, freaking diamox. Never again. I told my husband and he said and I quote ""as long as you stay with me I dont give a shit. Guess I'll have herpes too."" He is the most loving and loyal man I've ever met and I love him with all my heart. I will not lay with him while contagious though. Not only will he get it if he doesnt already have it, but that shit hurts. So we're moving forward I guess. I will work on moving forward and remind myself I am still human and bot dirty. Turns out it's a very very common things. Like 1 in 6 people have it. You all are awesome and I feel not so alone since using reddit. Thank you."

However, I have done tons of therapy etc. Whereas he has not done any therapy but is on antidepressants. (He is about to go to therapy for the first time this Friday). He struggles with anger management issues, but it’s not about me in any way. If anything it’s a result of childhood trauma. He gets mad at himself when he messes up. He can get mad if he accidentally breaks a glass while doing dishes or if I remind him to do something, he’ll get upset that he forgot to do it. Now the anger isn’t yelling or screaming. Most of the time he will go over and lay on the couch and get very upset with himself and cry. But sometimes he will get upset and then when he tries to do the next thing will kind of flip out again. Example: I once told him to please not do something and he got upset that he forgot that it was a rule so he got upset and went into our bathroom. When he tried to close the door there was laundry in the way and he kind of flailed his arms around aggressively to try and get the laundry away from the door so he could shut it. He then stopped and realized his actions were affecting me and apologized. But he doesn’t show any pre-aggressor behavior. He doesn’t sugar coat things or gas light me. He takes responsibility for his actions and apologizes. 

He understands that he has anger management issues. And he’s never gotten violent or yelled at me. But he just sometimes gets very upset with himself and it scares me because I worry he might take it out on me one day even though he never had (which is somewhat a result of minor trauma from my past and I have high anxiety). As I said before, he is going to start therapy very soon and is on meds. But, is there anything I can do in the short term day to day life so that both him and I can create something constructive out of it? 

I don’t want any “leave him” comments please. I only want constructive comments. He also knows I’m writing this."
1798,relationship_advice,Birthday present for gf,"My girlfriend has in a few days her birthday and I have no idea what I should get her, does anyone have any ideas for presents?"
1799,relationship_advice,Can I tell my neighbours to keep their children quiet,"So here's the deal, I live in a block of flats, in the UK. My neighbours who are lovely have 3 young daughters (I'd say 4,6 and 8). They all share a  bedroom, which shares a wall with mine. I've lived here for 8 years, no problems.  Until recently. 

The kids are quiet until about 2 in the morning when they laugh and scream and bang on the wall, which keep me awake. I'm freelance so i both have work and have to keep pitching for work and it;'s really messing me up. Can I say something? 

I'm reluctant to do so because the mum doesn't speak very good english, and the dad works most of the time. (I think they are under some financial strain, fwiw). It's also only a problem because of lockdown. The schools are closed so the kids don't have to be up in the morning, nor have they burned off enough energy during the day.  The mum (i can hear her too) is clearly just playing with her kids and enjoying the fact that she doesn't have to wake them up in the morning.  And who can blame her, quite honestly.  I'm also not a parent and can't imagine how tough this time is for them. But I'm really exhausted.

(I don;t know when schools are going to open. 'Some schools' are opening on June first but i think those are just some year groups.)  


Any thoughts? Should I just wait it out? And if I say something, how? (I could also bang on the wall when it's happening). I'm a big believer that tolerating noise is part of living in a city. I don't know what the limits are."
1800,relationship_advice,My [M24] life has a lot more structure than my girlfriend's [F24] how can we better co-exist?,"I work from home, running my own business. This has led to me being really structured in order to make sure I keep up with all the things I need to do.

She does suffer from depression and anxiety slightly, but mostly she is just a disorganised person. Totally fine with me, we're all different and she does want to get better.

However, we are often at loggerheads over things revolving around my routine. The current big one is that I eat dinner at what most adults would call dinner time, between 7-8 sometimes closer to 9. She wants to eat at 5, and I don't want to stop her but she wants to eat together. I feel that I'm not hungry enough so early, and also I then get hungry later (as we go to bed late). If I eat at 8, I'm hungry enough for dinner and full enough to not eat before bed.

What's a happy medium in a situation like this? At the moment, we just push close to 7 if she's hungry and I try to not go too late."

1901,discordapp,Introducing Tabs to Android!,"Hi everyone!

Starting today, we will begin rolling out the latest Discord app (version 20) to Android users with a new, simplified experience that makes the app easier to navigate.

[Click here for information about the update!](https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/360042584732)

As always, let us know if you have any feedback or thoughts on this update!

\---

**Edit:** First, thank you all for taking the time to provide feedback. Discord is where we’re at today because of the continued support and involvement of the community. Below is a brief summary of the motivations behind the changes, and if you’d like more details on each, check them out here. 

**Get to your conversations faster**

You’ll notice that we got rid of the drawer and moved to sliding panels. This allowed us to implement a couple of better gestures:

* Easier on the thumbs, you can swipe from any area on the screen to navigate between panels. It also resolves conflicts with Android 10 back gestures (previously too easy to trigger system back when trying to open drawer).
* Save navigation time by ""peeking"" at a new activity without having to leave your current chat.

**Improved access to features**

Next, you'll notice the new bottom tabs. We wanted to find a way to expose important features in a more mobile-native way while [respecting each platform’s rules](https://material.io/components/bottom-navigation).

* Home tab: communicating is front and center for main chat across servers and DMs.
* Friends tab: It took up to 5 gestures to get to a friend request. Now it takes only 3, and requests get their own notification badges.
* Quick Switcher and Recent Mentions: It’s now easier to navigate around and find messages relevant to you. In our experiments, we found this usage increased significantly!
* User settings: Where your avatar and status live. Long press this tab to set your status.

Conversations are still the main event so tabs will slide them away when you’re viewing a channel or DM.

**The future**

Tabs give us the flexibility to keep making Discord more useful to our users. As an example, millions of users on desktop have used server discovery to find communities relevant to their interests. With tabs, we now have a few options to bring a better way to discover new servers to mobile without cluttering the app."

While using Discord on Chrome, as well as Jitsi Meet on Chrome, and Microsoft Teams as an Electron app, I do not have any issue at all, through Voicemeeter or not.

But, while using the Electron app, I have voice stuttering issues, only through Voicemeeter.

Another intriguing fact is that only my friends could experience the issue, because the ""let's check"" feature isn't affected at all.

To finish, disabling all sound enhancements doesn't change anything, and they work on Chrome anyway.

My audio is a bit weird on discord, I try listening to myself on Discord and I make some noise, some constant sound, and it keeps going in and out like I'm talking through a fan, but much slower offs and ons.

I know it's not my mic because if I use another app or windows monitoring (and obs) my sound is perfect.

1967,discordapp,macOS: Game Streaming Audio,"I tried streaming Jackbox to play with friends last week. The video was fine. I joined out Voice Chat channel and then shared my screen.

When I did that, though, I get the warning ""Sound may not be available when sharing a screen on your device.""

I know I enabled screen sharing in my OS privacy settings, so I'm not sure what else to try. Do I have to use something like Soundflower to loop the audio to the input source in Discord and then voice chat via my phone?

I'm sure I'm not the only one with this issue, but googling hasn't been much help.

One of my friends said he experienced something similar and had to factory reset his computer, and i'd really like to avoid that if possible."
1985,discordapp,Discord on Android becoming more tedious and redundant,"I'd like to somehow roll back — way back when it was nice and simple.

@Mentioning people was as easy as tapping their icon, but now I have to type it. Seriously, what the hell?

Muting useless channels to hide them now takes 1 extra wait and 1 extra tap, so making naturally redundant Discord servers easier to navigate now takes twice as long. Why would I wanna temporarily hide a channel anyway?

Additionally, hiding muted channels now takes 1 extra tap and 1 extra scroll, which I gotta do everytime I go on some severs.

Opening the gallery now takes 1 extra tap. Why would I even wanna hide it?

What was on the bottom tab used to take up a lot less of the screen for the same usability.

This new.... side scrolling thing(?) makes me wanna throw up. What was so wrong with just having them on top of each other?

Holding down on messages now doesn't show the message itself, which was useful for knowing what to type for which emote. I now have to search for it...

I used to have a sort of respect for Discord. I used to praise the old interface. Now I just think they're TRYING to get people to uninstall.

Edit: Oh well. On its own, communication is still easy, alright, just not as easy as before."

I somehow stopped using it, deleted it and forgot about it.. but now i can't actually find it again.

I remember it had a pretty modern looking interface and wasn't just a console like EasyRP - blue-ish tone with round edges. It had different ""presets"" you could create and all kinds of different features like time stamps..

Anybody happens to know which tool i'm talking about?"
1998,discordapp,Cannot hear anyone in VC," 

Hi, so a few days ago I was playing and then I joined a VC with my friend and I couldnt hear him but he could hear me.. And I tried doing anything to solve this but I couldnt since I didnt find anything. I still didnt find a solution but I have this : When I am idle and dont play any game I can hear everyone, but when I join a game for example : CSGO I instantly cannot hear anyone. Is there any solutions to this? Please tell me in the comments. And this wasnt happening before. Addition : Now I cannot hear anyone when joining idle."
1999,discordapp,Ghost Discord server join,"Hey all, tried searching it but I keep getting a situation where a person joins my server but they cannot be assigned roles at all and don't appear on member list. I have ""5 minutes registered on Discord"" level of moderation and have full admin/owner.

Sometimes it happens from people I don't know but there are also times where it happens when I know them personally and they have had a Discord account for a long time. Is this a glitch? Did I mess something up in permissions?

Usually the member (white, no role) just appears in the member list  when they join but there are these occassions it doesn't work and it bugs me ;)

EDIT: Just noticed - the server member count goes up but they are not to be found on the list.

EDIT2: I have found a probable cause for this behaviour about an hour ago. Member said they accepted the invite, at that time a message appeared in the server announcing a new arrival, then they said they had to log out and log in again to their Discord account at which time another message popped up on the server (x appeared on the server) but this time with all the functionality - no duplicate member on the list tho.

TL;DR - some sort of sync issue between servers and users."

Since then, thanks to https://redd.it/gk9fea and other posts I've been keeping track of it with Sept 18 $20c from a couple weeks back with the big hedge fund buy.

Loaded up on more calls today from the dip, there is strong support at $11.30-11.50. Analysts and stocktwits are bullish, and IV should spike tmrw from the confirmation hearing and vote, also for the next couple weeks from each milestone.

There are those that think MM's are artificially pushing prices down for the May 29 expiry as the put calls ratio tells the story of a lot more ppl buying calls.

2064,wallstreetbets,David Rosenberg's idea that the stock market has nothing to do with the economy,"He was just on CNBC and basically made the point that there's about a 90% correlation between growth in the fed's balance sheet and returns on the S&P 500 over recent years, and that when you look at this rally, the market gap growth in the stock market is almost exactly equal to the growth in the fed's balance sheet ($3 trillion). He also added that if you look at the correlation between GDP growth and returns of SPX, it has basically been 0 for awhile. 

Everyone has made the claim that the stock market is not the economy, but that's not his point. Not only does the stock market not equal the economy, it actually has pretty much nothing to do with it. He also made the point of how the S&P was flat for much of 2019, until the fed started doing more repo, and the market went up 30%."

2070,wallstreetbets,DraftKings CEO Sees Potential Growth in In-Game Betting,"DraftKings CEO Jason Robins says the company is developing more in-game betting opportunities for users of the company’s popular sports wagering website, calling it “our No. 1 focus from a product perspective.”

“In the U.K., in-game is about 75% of the revenues at sports books and here’s it’s much lower,” Robins tells Barron’s. “You can bet on almost anything in an EPL (English Premier League soccer) game including who will get the next yellow card. Arguably, U.S. sports like baseball are better built for this because of the stoppage in play.”

“Think about baseball, there is so much opportunity to make prop bets,” Robins says, referring to wagers unrelated to the outcome of the game. Outside the U.S., tennis is popular for in-game wagering. “People are betting on every point. It’s literally at that level,” Robins says.

Viewers of the charity pro-am golf match on Sunday between the team of Tiger Woods and Peyton Manning against Phil Mickelson and Tom Brady got a chance to see DraftKings in-match odds onscreen during the broadcast. DraftKings (ticker: DKNG) offered betting on the individual holes and the overall match, which was narrowly won by Woods and Manning.

The match was the biggest golf event ever for DraftKings, doubling its previous top handle, a company spokesman said Tuesday. The in-game betting was a major factor, and golf is well-suited to it.

Shares of DraftKings were up more than 3%, at $30.08, at midday on Tuesday. The stock has surged about 70% since April, valuing DraftKings at $10 billion, behind only Las Vegas Sands (LVS) in the U.S. gambling sector.

2084,wallstreetbets,The Immediate Bull Case for Pager Duty $PD,"What is Pager Duty? 

Pager Duty is an IT Operations platform for incident response that allows companies to easily set up on-call rotations and communication protocols for engineers responsible for keeping services alive or recovering them if they do fail. You can think PagerDuty like the pavers that physicians and other practitioners wear during rotations so that they can promptly respond to issues. 

Why is PD such a critical company? 

As retail, education, and entertainment drastically shift online and more users rely on the Internet, strain on information systems grows. In short, there are more incidents. Pager Duty not only landed more customers during this period, but also likely saw revenue growth via its per user subscription model as more engineers have likely been added to on-call rotations. Their customers include DoorDash and Stripe, two companies benefiting heavily from the Shelter-in-place orders here in the states. 

The history of the stock price?

ER 6/4 

Pager Duty is trading at $26.62, or about a $2 B valuation, or roughly half of their ATH following their IPO. They have unjustifiably continued to slide since exiting the lockup period and trade a multiple lower than other newcomers in their industry. 

Their earnings report will contain more than two months of Shelter-in-Place related revenue. Meanwhile, their customers are scrambling to hire the sort of engineers that get Pager Duty accounts on the first day. Revenue will be up. 

Position?

$30 Call 6/19. 

What about their continued losses?

That should be considered a positive. The company is investing heavily in innovation and preparing a platform that will be resilient through a period of long-term growth.

Industry insights?

Pager Duty’s platform offers the easiest solution to set up, and scales using a very efficient technology stack built on the Erlang Virtual Machine (based on job postings and employee skills). That’s the same virtual machine that enabled WhatsApp to scale with very few engineers, and it’s the same virtual machine powering Discord chat. The reliability and efficiency for concurrent connections is a margin driver long-term, even though it’s hard to get started. It’s that good. 

Pager Duty’s transparent pricing model and value drivers make it very appealing to people looking to call an API and keep it moving. There are no threatening legacy solutions in the space. 

They also recently opened an Atlanta office, which is a hotbed for strong engineering talent from Georgia Tech. Ops and Security are Atlanta’s sweet spots. 

Competition?

SquadCast - nobody important afaik
VictorOps - great solution, growing, but lots of ground to gain on features, revenue, and ease-of-use. 
DIY - You could probably build something custom in-house if you have 8-10 engineers to spare, and strong knowledge of your APM infrastructure. Most companies are far too fragmented for this sort of work and would fail before running to Pager Duty, but some have built sophisticated solutions. 
Twilio - Most likely an acquisition target than a competitive player long term. They aren’t built for IT Operations. 

Customers?

Shopify, Amazon, and Zoom (see case study below):

https://www.pagerduty.com/customer/zoom-video-communications/

Why are they down so much? Why has the market ignored them? Since web traffic has tripled, I expect incident response teams at software companies to have at least doubled. The obvious shift to cloud computing makes them more appealing, yet they can be implemented to work for on-premise environments as well. I plan to invest heavily in Pager Duty long term. What do you think?"

2086,wallstreetbets,DD for next 10 days (#PandemicCancelled plays),"Today Vegas will most likely announce reopening for **June 4th**. It's not official yet but pretty much everyone knows that's the date. $**MGM** was one of the hardest hit of the Vegas stocks, $**WYNN** and $**LVS** are good plays too but I prefer MGM. If there is anyone who is likely to take a risk on Corona is gonna be the gamblers and Johns. People forget Johns are a huge portion of Vegas business. Corona is nothing compared to HIV or Hepatitis B that Johns risk every day. What about reduced casino capacity? they will take out low limit tables, which will force the cheap players to up their game and lose money faster on medium level tables. There is plenty of slutmachines, they are never close to 50% utilized. So no issues there. The only problem is corporate events that are cancelled, but you are playing the news so that doesn't matter.

&#x200B;

Bombardier recreational division ($**DOOO**) will be reporting this week. They had an amazing quarter and sold a lot of ATVs, sea-doos and Can-Am bikes to people with stimulus cheques. They also benefited from stronger USD since the make a lot of their stuff in Canada. They had a poor 2019 because of short winter selling few ski-doos, so expectations are low. Also people who are not going on family vacations due to social distancing are buying a lot of Sea-doos. **Earnings call June 28th BMO.**

&#x200B;

DocuSign (**$DOCU**) and Zoom ($**ZM**) are reporting next week. Both are Corona stocks. I expect both will report spectacular earnings but not sure how the market will react since Pandemic is cancelled. [https://preview.redd.it/sh02gkdo32151.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=2100c6d2236e1c22ce1083af5fa18c1edf19cc4b](https://preview.redd.it/sh02gkdo32151.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=2100c6d2236e1c22ce1083af5fa18c1edf19cc4b) I closed my DOCU positions but keeping ZM up until day before earnings.

&#x200B;

**Aritzia** ($**ATZ.TO)** is essentially Lululemon for people who are too cool for Lulu. They had an amazing online sales due to pandemic. They are also benefiting from stronger US dollar since they are based in Canada just like LULU. This is a Becky stock and they report **June 28th AMC.**

&#x200B;

**Sea World ($SEAS)**  gets most of its revenue year round compared to the other theme parks. It's very seasonal but less so than SIX or Disney parks. It's EXACTLY half the price of February highs. It has no competition when it comes to #dolphinEntertainment. Since #PandemicIsCancelled, the **upside is 1X**. Never bet against dolphins and killer whales.

&#x200B;

$**SPCE** Thursday morning all headlines are going to read '*America enters a new space age*'. Wednesday will be the first human launch from USA since 2011.  [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/26/spacex-demo-2-nasa-astronaut-launch-everything-you-need-to-know.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/26/spacex-demo-2-nasa-astronaut-launch-everything-you-need-to-know.html) .

2088,wallstreetbets,KR breakout going to happen,"I think there is potentially a play in KR coming up in the next few weeks.  All common sense says groceries stores should be insulated from 🍺🦠. It also says they are not the most exciting stonks to play normally.

So my thought is KR saw upgrades or PT increases from Wells Fargo and JP.  Then proceeded to fall even father an a day when market went way up.  Most likely due to people pulling money from a safe play to get in on the exciting plays.  Think in terms of bots trading and rate of change. 

Besides the upgrades there is also a Zacks article on value and earnings pitting KR vs WMT in which KR wins. 

All this leads to believe KR will correct for drop today regardless of markets in near future. This upward correction will compound with positive news to build enough momentum for the rate of change bots to jump on board and run this baby up past the $33 resistance and into the $34-$38 range where it may form new base.

Maybe it doesn't happen exactly like this but 7/17 34c are less then $1 and I have a hard time believing KR isn't going up at least 10% in the next month and a half. 

Tl;dr KR 7/17 34c because meat and potatoes can't go tits up."

As some of you may already be aware, certain users are receiving private messages – ostensibly from moderators of large subreddits – in which they are told that they've won a gift card, a cash prize, or a robotic ferret. (I may have made that last one up.) Anyway, we wanted to take a moment to inform everyone of the following:

**If you receive a private message telling you that you've won something, it is a scam.**

There are a number of ways that illicit accounts operate on Reddit. More often than not, spammers pump up their karma scores until they're past a certain threshold, then either sell their accounts or start submitting links to malware-infested websites and shady retail outlets. ([This brief guide](https://redd.it/3jss04) will tell you how to spot them... and if that's too long for you, [this tongue-in-cheek video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlrtcStl2bU) will offer the same information.)

More recently, though, we've seen this new breed of parasite making the rounds. They register usernames that look like they could be associated with various Reddit communities (provided that you don't examine their profile pages too closely), then they contact users directly, thereby bypassing most of what moderators can do to combat them. If you receive one of their messages, here's what to do:

1. Do not click any of the links that it provides.
2. [Report the account to the administrators](https://www.reddit.com/report).
3. Block the account in question.

Remember, everyone, if something seems too good to be true, it usually is.

That's why we don't have robotic ferrets yet, sadly."

The remaining 10 teams would be done for the season. The survey sent to each general manager noted that “tiers” would first be created using the regular-season standings to ensure competitive balance between the groups.

>For example, the 20 teams could be allocated into five tiers in descending order by record.

>Tier 1: Bucks, Lakers, Raptors, Clippers

>Tier 2: Celtics, Nuggets, Jazz, Heat

>Tier 3: Thunder, Rockets, Pacers, Sixers

>Tier 4: Mavericks, Grizzlies, Nets, Magic

>Tier 5: Blazers, Pelicans, Kings, Spurs

>Groups could then be randomly drawn, with one team from each tier going into each group. The NBA is working on approaches to fairly balance the groupings, such as limiting each group to only three Western Conference teams, according to multiple front office sources.

The remaining 8 teams play each other in a best of five series to determine who faces the top seeds. Match ups will be based on standings. (5 vs 12, 6 vs 11, 7 vs 10, 8 vs 9)

Assuming the top four seeds remain the same after round robin, below would be the match ups. Also, 4-8 would be reseeded after winners are decided.

I'm going to structure this as peak for both playoffs and regular season, and then accolades. First, peak.

Wade's peak regular season is considered 2008-09, and Kobe's is considered 2005-06. I'll use per 100 possessions to account for pace.

Kobe: 45.6/6.8/5.8/2.4/0.5, 55.9% TS (2.3% above league average)

28.0 PER, 11.6 OWS, 3.7 DWS, 15.3 WS, 0.224 WS/48,  7.4 OBPM, 0.2 DBPM, 7.6 BPM, 8.0 VORP

1st team all defense, scoring title

Wade: 41.8/7.0/10.3/3.0/1.9, 57.4% TS (3% above league average)

30.4 PER, 10.3 OWS, 4.4 DWS, 14.7 WS, 0.232 WS/48, 8.2 OBPM, 2.4 DBPM, 10.6 BPM, 9.6 VORP

2nd team all defense (3rd in DPOY voting), scoring title


I think Wade's peak is overall better than Kobe's. He's scoring 3.8 less points per 100, but dishing 4.5 more assists, and he's scoring more efficiently. He finished 2nd team to Kobe's 1st team, but he had widely better defensive stats. However, advanced defensive stats are mostly trash. For another perspective though, Wade also finished 3rd in DPOY voting.

Now for playoffs:

Wade's peak playoff series: 

33.2/5.6/6.8/1.6/1.6, 65.0% TS

Kobe's peak playoff series: 

34/5.8/5.8/0.8/0.5, 62.7% TS

I think this is very close, with Kobe's being against the Nuggets in 2009, and Wade's being against Boston in 2010. Both good defensive teams. I'd call this a wash.


Now for accolades:

Kobe: 5 rings, 2 FMVPs, 1 MVP, 2x scoring champ, 18x all star, 15x all-NBA, 12x all-defense


Wade: 3 rings, 1 FMVP, 1 scoring champ, 13x all star, 8x all-NBA, 3x all-defense


Obviously, Kobe has the advantage here, but allow me to engage in the what-ifs I mentioned earlier.


Everyone remembers 2006, Wade averaging 35ppg to win the finals over Dallas. However, in 2005, the Heat were very close to another shot at the title. The Heat were up 3-2 to the Pistons, until Wade got hurt. He misses game 6, and plays injured in game 7, and the Heat lose the series. The Pistons go on to lose a tightly contested 7 game finals series against the Spurs. Now, obviously its a stretch to assume the Heat would've won the championship in 2005 if Wade stayed healthy, but at worst I think the Heat make the finals, with a good chance at a ring.


Then there's 2011. People remember LeBron choking, but Wade was the best player on the court for that series. Even further, the Mavs split the first 4 games, with the Heat losing games 2 and 4 by a total of 5 points. LeBron James averaged 17.2 points and 6.2 assists through the first 4 games of the series. Wade could've played just as well as he played, with LeBron putting up a 19 ppg instead of 17.2 ppg, and Dwyane Wade wins FMVP in a Heat sweep. 

Now yes, I realize those two things did not happen, and that they rely in what-ifs, it's the reason that this isn't a very good argument. However, I think it does lay out a solid foundation as to how close Wade was to challenging Kobe for 2nd best SG of all time. Just 2 swings of better luck, nothing to do with Wade's actual play, and Dwyane Wade finishes his career with 4 or 5 rings and 2 or 3 FMVPs, on 6 finals appearances.

This isn't meant to convince anyone that Wade is the 2nd best shooting guard of all time. I just wanted to lay out a foundation for an argument for it, even if it does rely on hypothetical.


What do you guys think?

I know what happened.”","https://nypost.com/2020/05/23/michael-jordan-accused-of-even-more-lies-in-last-dance/?utm_source=NYPTwitter&utm_medium=SocialFlow&utm_campaign=SocialFlow


Sam Smith, the author of “The Jordan Rules” and the former Chicago Tribune writer, poked some holes in the Michael Jordan documentary, as well. He said the notion Grant was his only source in the book was false and also laughed at the idea Jordan presented that himself, Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman and Phil Jackson would all have come back on one-year deals for the 1998-99 season had owner Jerry Reinsdorf made them offers. Jordan instead retired and the Bulls rid themselves of their main championship pieces, entering a rebuild that went on for almost a decade.

“That was a complete and blatant lie by Michael,” Smith said Thursday on 95.7 The Game. “There were several things in the documentary that I saw, I would know, that he made up or he lied about. They weren’t major things, but it was like when a TV movie comes on and they say, ‘this is based on a true story.’ That’s what that was. It was based on a true story.”"
2546,nba,Isiah Thomas made zero All-NBA teams in the 4 years leading up to the 1992 Olympics,"I'm not sure why there is any controversy about Isiah being left off the Dream Team. He failed to make any All-NBA team (1st, 2nd, or 3rd) in 89, 90, 91, and 92.

During that same time span:

* Stockton was All-NBA 4 times
* Kevin Johnson was All-NBA 4 times
* Mark Price was All-NBA 2 times
* Tim Hardaway was All-NBA once

If the Dream Team selected another point guard, it should have been KJ or Mark Price.

For those that may argue that Isiah was actually deserving and he wasn't included on any All-NBA teams in those years because he played on well-balanced, defensive-oriented teams, I would point you to Joe Dumars' selection in 90 and 91 and Chauncey Billups' selection in '06 and '07 playing in a similar situation."

However, lately the criticism surrounding this seems absolutely ridiculous. They told the whole story, didn't fabricate anything significant, didn't gloss over anything significant either. However, there was definitely small details that was presented in a one sided way, but nothing that changed the way we already looked at Jordan or the Bulls. 


I seen people call it nothing but a propaganda tape and MJ commercial. People say MJ has ""the entire plot under his full control"" and ""gets finals say on whats included and not"" etc. People say he is trashing his former teammates while making himself look like a god. That they gloss over his negatives while not doing the same for his teammates. 


Are we even watching the same documentary? 


They covered Jordan being an asshole to teammates, teammates being scared of him, gambling issues, missed game winners, the turnover in '95 that cost them a series, getting game winners scored on him by Armstrong and Miller, Jordan struggling in the '96 finals etc. What specifically did they exclude from the doc that was so important? Cause according to the creator Jordan didn't ask to have a single thing excluded. 


Did they let MJ comment on all these things to explain himself? Yes. Did they give that same opportunity to everyone else in the doc? Yes they did. 


Pippen got the opportunity to explain why he refused to enter the court and decided to say that he would do it all over again if given the chance. At that point its Pippen that makes himself look bad, has absolutely nothing to do with the documentary trying to give a biased view. 

They gave the man plenty of praise and they totally covered his bad contract, Jordan was very clear that they have no success and there is no Jordan without Pippen, his awsome road to success from such a poor upbringing etc. Same with Rodman. Were you guys even watching? 


Fact of the matter is that Pippen also had some questionable moments in his career. Should those have been glossed over? THAT would be biased if anything. They included his bad moments just like they did with Jordan and Rodman as well. Which is 100% fair. 


Then you have people pushing the narrative that Jordans teammates has been coming out to set the record straight. Who was it again? Oh Craig Hodges and Horace Grant, the only two guys who were already pissed at the doc for other reasons (being excluded/being called a snitch). Grant saying the doc is ""90% BS"" should definitely be taken with a grain of salt. 

What about the rest of the teammates, who took part in the actual doc, and said that they understood what Jordan was trying to accomplish and that he was pushing them? All the footage in the doc where his teammates were just laughing it off when Jordan talked shit? Lets pretend those dont exist. 


Then you have Rachel Nichols calling it biased for not including the Wizards years. Vernon Maxwell saying its biased for not including the Rockets winning the two years Jordan were retired etc. Like WTF? 


And for all the people saying Jordan was ""just"" an asshole. Watch the doc again. Listen to his teammates. They disagree with you. 


Fact of the matter is, most documentaries are biased, they are all pushing their agenda. If you think that Tiger King wasn't presented in a way that would make you sympathize with Joe Exotic and hate Carol Baskins then you are completely fooling yourself. 


This documentary was a biased view on Jordan and the 90's Bulls. Not worse than that. Its not propaganda, and its not trying to paint any teammates of his in a bad light, and it doesn't try to gloss over the negatives about him. 

Does it make you think than Pippen was a bum and Jordan carried those teams while acting like mother theresa the whole time? If thats what you wanted to see then yes. "

2558,nba,"[OC] Jordan's ""Flu Game"" was also reported as food poisoning in 1997","Many doubt that Jordan's 1997 Finals Game 5 condition was because of gastroenteritis, or food poisoning. Michael Jordan, his trainer Tim Grover, and his friend George Koehler seemingly pulled this out of nowhere for some people. However, I remember my local TV station in 1997 describing it as food poisoning, so I've been confused by the narrative that ""food poisoning"" was something Jordan's people started making up recently. This, combined with my experience as a healthcare provider seeing numerous cases of bacterial and viral gastroenteritis in the middle of the night, made me much less of a conspiracy theorist on this than most. 

#First of all, was there even a pizza delivered to Jordan that night? It appears so.

>https://kutv.com/sports/utah-jazz/utah-man-says-no-way-pizza-made-michael-jordan-sick-for-flu-game-in-1997-nba-finals

>https://kutv.com/news/local/second-account-of-pizza-delivered-to-jordan-before-flu-game

#Second, what would be the differences in clinical presentation of influenza, gastroenteritis, and a hangover?

**Flu** generally refers to **influenza**, a virus spread through respiratory droplets. Although influenza can present with fever, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, muscle aches, etc. - it is unlikely Jordan would have the flu without giving it to someone around him that series. And there is no evidence anyone else got sick.

**Food poisoning** generally refers to **gastroenteritis**, which is infection of the stomach with either a bacteria or virus. Sometimes it is called **stomach flu** which is a confusing term, because its etiology shares no commonalities with influenza. There are numerous bugs that can cause this, and some bugs cause predominantly nausea and vomiting while others can cause diarrhea, sometimes bloody. The explosive nature of Jordan's nausea and vomiting suggests - among viruses - norovirus (very common), or one of many bacteria, such as Staph aureus.

**Hangovers** - as many of you know, most commonly cause fatigue, thirst, headache, concentration issues, nausea, and stomach pain. However they very very rarely cause fever. For this reason, I personally find it extremely unlikely Jordan's symptoms were due to a hangover. Some suggest Jordan could have had altitude sickness, but if so, I would expect his symptoms in his first 48 hours in Utah. It would be exceedingly rare for such symptoms to pop up almost 2 weeks later, before game 5, in a hotel room.

#Third, what symptoms did Jordan even have?

>As this new season was about to begin, probably the most remarkable chapter thus far had been written the previous June, when he woke up violently ill before Game Five of the NBA Finals against the Utah Jazz. Whether it was altitude sickness or food poisoning no one was ever sure. Later, it was reported that he had woken up with a **fever** of 103. That was not true: His temperature was high but not that high, not over 100, but he had been so ill during the night that it seemed impossible that he would play. At about 8 A.M., Jordan's bodyguards called Chip Schaefer, the team trainer, to tell him that Jordan was deathly ill. Schaefer rushed to Jordan's room and found him **curled up in a fetal position, wrapped in blankets and pathetically weak**. He had not slept at all. He had an intense **headache** and had suffered **violent nausea** throughout the night. The greatest player in the world looked like a frail, weak zombie. It was inconceivable that he might play that day.

>Schaefer immediately hooked him onto an IV and tried to get as much fluid into him as possible. He also gave him some medication so he could rest that morning...

>Now, seeing him that sick in the Salt Lake City hotel room, Schaefer had a sense that Jordan might somehow manage to play, that Michael Jordan might, as he sometimes did in situations like this, use this illness as a motivational tool, one more challenge to overcome. He did make it to the locker room before the game, still frail and weak. Word circulated quickly among journalists that he had the flu and that his **temperature was 102**, and many assumed that he would not play.

2568,nba,"Something interesting about each NBA team (Hawks, Celtics, Nets)","Pt. 1 of a series I might do

Atlanta Hawks:

The St. Louis Hawks were one of the best teams in the league throughout the 50s and 60s, but fan attendance always suffered especially when the team started to sign more black players and also because of the arrival of the all-white St. Louis Blues. Bill Russell was traded from the Hawks to the Celtics stating ""St. Louis was overwhelmingly racist. If I would've gotten drafted by St. Louis. I wouldn't have in the NBA."" Another instance of racism occurred when St. Louis blackballed their 8th overall pick Cleo Hill. Despite Hill dropping 26 points in his first ever game and having star potential, Hawks management ordered coach Paul Seymour to give more minutes to Pettit, Hagan, and Lovellete and diminish Cleo Hill's role in hopes of gaining a better in reputation in St. Louis. Seymour refused and was later fired. Bob Pettit became the player/coach and Cleo Hill's chances of playing minutes were gone. Hill's confidence was gone and he was released in 1962 and it is widely accepted that Hawks owner Ben Kerner requested to all the owners not to sign Cleo Hill and Cleo never played in the NBA again.

Boston Celtics: 

The Parquet Floor, the most unique basketball floor in history, saw some of the greatest players, teams, and games ever. Some sections of the parquet floor played on today is the same floor that Larry Bird and Bob Cousy played on. It is the only court that uses Red Oak and it is 12% harder than any other court in the league making the ball slightly less bouncy. Players like Sam Jones and Dennis Johnson used the dead spots to their advantage avoiding the spots on offense and heading opponents to dead spots on defense. So even when Bill Laimbeer spits on the Leprechaun or when KG kisses it, there is a certain mystique and beauty to Boston's hardwood that remains unchanged.

Brooklyn Nets:

KD and Kyrie Irving might of temporarily changed the Brooklyn/New York dynamic, but for most of Brooklyn's history they were always the bullied little brother. The feud between New York and at that time the New York Nets started in the ABA. The Knicks were displeased when hearing the news that they will have to share New York with another basketball team. The Nets were originally going to play in Manhattan but the Knicks forced them out 3 months before the ABA season started and forced the Nets to change their name to the New Jersey Americans too. However, poor conditions in New Jersey forced them to move back to New York and they again started over in New York as the Nets. Fast forward to 1976, the Nets applied to join the NBA, but were forced to pay $4.8 million to the Knicks for ""invading their territory"". The Nets offered Julius Erving to the Knicks instead, however the Knicks refused to acquire Dr. J (they wanted cash) and instead gave up Erving to 76ers for roughly the same amount the Knicks ordered. Tensions continued after the Nets attempted to move from Long Island to New Jersey, but once again the Knicks tried to block the move. This caused the only lawsuit between two teams in NBA history where the Nets sued the Knicks for violating anti-trust laws. Yet again, the Nets couldn't even defeat the Knicks in the court of law and they settled to pay the Knicks another 4 million in addition to an NBA fine forcing the Nets to swap 3 first round picks to the Knicks in 78/79 drafts. In the year 1996 fortunes changed for the Nets however. James Dolan needed approval from all owners in the NBA to own the Knicks but the Nets stated they would only vote for Dolan if the Knicks gave up the territorial rights in New York. The Knicks were cornered and were forced to agree and 16 years later the Nets found a new home as the Brooklyn Nets."

2574,nba,[Highlight] Harden crossing the ever hell out of Beverley. Wait till the end!,
2575,nba,"[Wojnarowski] The NBPA’s Michele Roberts is conducting team-by-team conference calls with players, detailing talks with NBA on formats for resumption of play in Orlando, financial implications of those options and gathering feedback, sources tell ESPN.",
2576,nba,Why do people hate on the 2013 draft class way more than 2014?,"The 2014 class received massive amounts of hype at the time. It was toted as the best class we had seen in recent years and even compared to 1996 class by slam (a class that included AI, Kobe, Ray Allen, Nash, and countless others). Looking back at it, the draft wasn't very good, the only real superstars who came out of it were Embiid and Jokic, and while it also produced some solid players like Smart, Randle, Nurkic and others it's fair to say the class was a big disappointment overall. On the other hand, the 2013 draft was regarded as a terrible year by most, yet it had talents like Giannis, Oladipo, Gobert, Steven Adams and CJ McCollum come out of it. I would argue 2013 has a slight edge talent-wise and it also didn't have any real disappointment considering it wasn't even supposed to be a good year, unlike 2014 which was supposed to be very good and was a flop. So why does everyone regard 2013 as such a terrible draft when 2014 was worse and more disappointing?"
2577,nba,Manu deserves more recognition for 2004,"Manu Ginobili leading Argentina to a Gold Medal in the 2004 Olympics isn’t talked about enough. Him leading the charge in the win over the US in the semifinals made the USMNBT completely re-evaluate the entire organization. Argentina defeated the US in the semis 89-81, with Manu leading all scorers with 29 on 9/13 and 4/6 from deep. Argentina then defeated Italy to win Gold. 

It wasn’t a one man show, as Manu had NBA players such as Luis Scola, Andres Nocioni, Fabricio Oberto, and others by his side, but he was the definitive driving force behind that Gold Medal squad. Manu averaged 19/4/3/1.5 on 57% shooting over the course of the Games. 

I am a firm believer that Manu could’ve been the #1 option on an NBA team. He never had the chance in San Antonio, but he proved in 2004 he was capable of leading a team. Where do you rank Manu all time? I think he deserves to be in the conversation for top 50, but he’s a lock for the top 75 to me."
2578,nba,I created a tool called PAWS (Preferred Award Weighted Score) where you can make your greatest NBA players list by determining the weighted value of different awards.,"**Background:**

I feel that a lot of the debate about the greatest NBA player lists is because people value certain parts of a player's career more than others. For example, some people may think championships are less about the player and more about the team. Or that all-stars are pointless because the fans and players make stupid choices. I decided to make PAWS so that people can see how their preferences affect who they think are great.

**Methodology:**

So, I started to create PAWS by listing most major awards a player can win. I then added 80 players in NBA history (mostly from ESPN's top 74 list) with their awards counts. You can now edit the weight of each award, and it'll give you a score to compare with other players using the same weight on their achievements. It will appear it graph form, where you can visualize different tiers, and tabular form where you can see the order and ranks more easily.

[**Here**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zHdhsjfBV-kzvU2H66bkOIIxnOVvpyC6j94bejooMVQ/edit#gid=1130354099) **is the spreadsheet.** If you want to use it, **make a copy** and only edit the cells highlighted in **green.**

There are so many interesting things you can try to do with the tool, including trying to get certain players to the number one slot or just trying out different preferences. Keep in mind that values can be negative and if you think they are irrelevant, you can make them worth 0.

**Flaws:**

There are some obvious flaws, such as current players just don't have as much time to get awards as retired players, examples being Giannis and Steph. Additionally, there are players who impact the game far beyond awards, such as Reggie Miller. The last flaw I would like to bring up is the fact that it is difficult to quantify how dominant a player is outside of awards and statistics. Additionally, many awards are driven by storylines, such as Kobe only winning 1 MVP, and this is not reflected in PAWS.

There were many more statistics I could have included, and if you guys would want an advanced version of PAWS or more players added, just let me know."
2579,nba,Who's the best player that spent their entire career on your team?,"I'm always thinking about this question. As a Raps fan, its pretty tough to decide. Wondering what you guys think for your own teams."
2580,nba,Why did Toronto keep Kyle Lowry after winning the title?,"That is a great question.

It’s probably because the 2019 Toronto Raptors don’t have an ass-to-risk."
2581,nba,"LaMelo Ball's NBL coach: “He sleeps, drinks basketball. That’s his whole world and everything he does. There’s a perception about LaMelo from what you see online but that’s nothing like what you see inside the team group.""","Hawks coach Matt Flinn says he was immediately surprised by LaMelo’s attitude. Any assumptions he might have had about his new recruit were quickly put to rest when training got underway.

“The first thing I noticed about LaMelo was just how joyful he was,” Flinn says from his home shortly after the enforced lockdown. “He sleeps, drinks basketball. That’s his whole world and everything he does.

“There’s a perception about LaMelo from what you see online but that’s nothing like what you see inside the team group.

“He enjoys other people succeeding; a lot of people think it’s all about him. It’s not. He’s a really special kid in that way.”

2585,nba,How the 24 team playoffs that the NHL would work in the NBA,"So if you were not aware today the NHL announced there plans to resume play today and I will be explaining how it would work in the nba. So basically what the NHL is doing is it’s still gonna be a traditional 16 team playoffs but they are adding a first round bye like the nfl does for the bottom four teams. So this is how it would look like

East

1: Bucks

2:Raptors

3:Celtics 

4: Heat

West

1:Lakers

2: Clippers

3: Nuggets

4: Jazz 

These following teams are all safe from playoff elimination and will do a round robin for seeding (I will explain that later)

Now the following teams will play a 5 game series to decide if they or another team will make the playoffs

East

5: Pacers

6: 76ers 

7: Nets

8: Magic

West

5: Thunder

6: Rockets

7: Mavericks 

8: Grizzlies

These teams would not be safe and would have a chance to be eliminated in a 5 game series from 4 more teams in each conference the 5 would face the 12 seed for a playoff berth,6 would face the 11, 7 would face the 10 and the 8 seed would face the 9 seed for a playoff spot this would like 

East

5 Pacers vs 12 Knicks 

6 76ers vs 11 Bulls

7 Nets vs 10 Hornets 

8 Magic vs 9 Wizards

West

5 Thunder vs 12 spurs

6 Rockets vs 11 Kings

7 Mavericks vs 10 Pelicans 👀

8 Grizzlies vs 9 Trailblazers

So those are going to be the best of 5 matches of the nba decides for 24 team playoffs. After that the regular playoff schedule begins with 1 vs 8 or 9, 2 vs 7 or 10,3 vs 6 or 11 and 4 vs 5 or 12 in there own respective conference 

Now the Round Robin. I was confused by this at first but it’s pretty simple. The 4 teams in each conference will each play each other once. 3 games in total for each team and depending on the record the that decides the playoff seeding so if the Bucks went 3-0 the raps went 2-1 the Heat went 1-2 and the Celtics went 0-3 then the standings would change and would look like

Milwaukee: 1

Raptors: 2

Heat: 3

Celtics: 4

This changed because the heat won more games in the round robin then the Celtics so they have the higher seed (Celtics fans don’t get mad this is just an example)

Now if the round robin were to happen we would see these matchups

East

Raptors vs Bucks

Raptors vs Celtics

Raptors vs Heat

Heat vs Celtics

Heat vs Bucks

Celtics vs Bucks

WEST 

Lakers vs Clippers

Lakers vs NuggetS

Lakers vs Jazz 

Clippers vs Nuggets

Clippers vs Jazz

Nuggets vs Jazz

these would be the round robin matchups we would see

DRAFT LOTTERY:

This is the confusing part and I’m not really sure I’m 100 percent right but this is how the lottery would go (I might be a bit wrong). So the 13-15 seeds from both conferences would automatically be entered in the draft lottery. Then depending on whichever team wins the the best of 5 the losing team will enter the lottery and be whichever record the bottom team is. For example let’s say the Bulls pull off a miracle and eliminate the sixers in a best of 7 then that would mean that the Bulls would now be the six seed and the 76ers now replace the bulls in the draft lottery and take there position and let’s say the pacers beat the Knicks in the round 1 matchup then nothing would change and the Knicks still stay in their current position. I’m not sure if this is 100 percent how the draft lottery will work however 

Hopefully this is a good explanation and now you understand how the NBA would work if the did what the nhl is doing. I’m not promoting this or saying this is what they should do but this is just a explanation on how it would work"
2586,nba,Are the 19-20 Raptors the 93-94 Bulls?,"The Bulls were coming off a championship in 92-93, Jordan retires, they keep the team and they only lose 2 more games in 93-94 than the previous year. And they had 3 All Stars that year I’m pretty sure, Pippen, Grant and Armstrong.

The Raptors kept their team, lost Kawhi to the Clippers, but the roleplayers got better and Siakam is now an all star. If the season went as planned they would be on pace to about 59 wins, which would tie the franchise record set in 2017-18.

How similar do you think these two teams are?"
2587,nba,NBA Viewership,"Hey everyone, for my marketing research class final project I'm doing a project on NBA viewership and would really appreciate all of your thoughts to my following questions! If you wouldn't mind, leave your gender and age range (for demographic purposes only). Thanks and stay clean!!

1. What would it take for you to pay for an NBA subscription (League Pass, TV subscription)?
2. Where do you watch your NBA games?

2589,nba,What do you say to people who think that NBA is fake?,My Co-workers were talking about how NBA controls the teams' championships and the players are acting. They compared NBA to the WWE and said they're both just for show to make money. They had lots of other comments. I'm a NBA fan but I stayed quiet cause I felt I couldn't convince them otherwise. What would you say to them?
2590,nba,"Cavaliers' Andre Drummond surprises worker with $1,000 tip at Florida restaurant",
2591,nba,The Evolving Athlete Argument,"One of the things that brings passionate discussion to this board is comparing players in different eras. Obviously the argument will never definitively be closed, but one of the talking points that comes up is how today’s athletes are better trained and conditioned.

It is true, for sure. There are advancements in medicine, nutrition, equipment, diagnostics, training methods, travel, sleep/rest science etc. But if you take the athlete off the past and bring them to the present, wouldn’t they also benefit from the same advancements? Imagine a guy like Oscar Robertson plus the benefit of today’s science and technology."

2593,nba,Why did Jerry Krause hate Phil Jackson?,"Even after watching the Last Dance I still don't understand why Jerry came to resent and hate Phil so much. Phil is never shown or represented as someone to bully or demean Krause like Michael and Scotty would at times.

Was Phil actually doing things like the jokes those guys were saying or what?"
2594,nba,Sources: Pistons starting search for GM to work with Ed Stefanski,
2595,nba,"If Giannis does not win a championship thru out his career, what would your thoughts be?","I would be pretty surprised but then would think about all of the legends that did not get a ring. Chuck, C Webb, Stockton, Malone, Nash, Miller, etc. It is never guaranteed in this league and a new team can always come out of nowhere to change that. But if he does not get a ring and keeps getting MVPs, what would your thoughts be?"
2596,nba,Tracy McGrady's BEST 40 Plays!,
2597,nba,"Besides the Spurs, what are some examples of team culture?","I've heard a lot about how the Spurs have a selfless, team based culture, but never that much about others. What are some examples of other team cultures?"
2598,nba,Does any team get more of an advantage from the proposed season/playoff re-start than the Rockets?,"Thinking about it, it feels like a big win for Houston and their title chances. They get to have a full training camp in the new system, and they get a fully rested Harden when the knock is usually he's gassed out in the playoffs. Plus the recovery of guys like Tucker, Covington and Gordon to leave them better equipped to take the beating in the post they'll have to survive in the playoffs. And assuming we go straight to the playoffs it's less games for other teams to scout the system (the counter arguement is that other teams have had three months to study the Rockets film). Not saying it makes them favorites or anything crazy like that, but it seems like a good thing for their chances barring something crazy like Harden coming back 25 pounds overweight."
2599,nba,How high of an esteem do you hold the Sloan/Malone/Stockton Jazz for their year-to-year consistency?,"It seems like a lot make a big point about how the Jazz didn't win a Championship and didn't peak as high as other teams and use that to say the trio was ""overrated"", but does enough attention get given to just how consistent they were on a year-to-year basis while together, which was Spurs-lite in some ways. Here are their year to year records:

1988-89 (Sloan midseason replacement): 40-25

1989-90: 55-27

1990-91: 54-28

1991-92: 55-27

1992-93: 47-35

1993-94: 53-29

1994-95: 60-22

1995-96: 55-27

1996-97: 64-18

1997-98: 62-20

1998-98: 37-13

1999-00: 55-27

2000-01: 53-29

2001-02: 44-38

2002-03: 47-37

Total Record: 781-400 (.661), with 13 straight years with at least 47 wins (pro-rated for the partial seasons) and 12/13 with at least 50 wins (pro-rated for the partial seasons). You rarely see organizations maintain that type of year-to-year consistency. Really puts an interesting case study into ""peak vs. longevity"" discussions."

## Virtual Conventions

Since it's unlikely for large gatherings to happen for some time, some conventions have moved online with industry panels, Q&A sessions, cosplay, vendors, and more. We're gathering a list of them here to check out over the summer as well. (At least with these you don't have to worry about hotels...)

2602,anime,"Recommendation Tuesdays Megathread - Week of May 26, 2020","
Need a recommendation or have one to share? This is your thread! This thread is active all week, so you can post in it when it's not Tuesday and still get an answer! :)

If you have a recommendation to share that's well written and longer than 1.5k characters, consider instead posting a [WT!] (Watch This!) thread.

If you'd like to look through the previous WT! threads to find recommendations or check if there is already one for your favourite show, [click here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13JtLBsaUlkIYgokKV0CQo0naTL7TuVcTELturmAVRxo/edit#gid=0)

**Not sure how to ask for a recommendation?** Fill this out, or simply use it as a guideline, and other users will find it much easier to recommend you an anime!

*I'm looking for:* A certain genre? Something targeted like characters travelling to another world?

*Shows I've already seen that are similar:* You can include a link to a list on another site if you have one, e.g. MyAnimeList or AniList.

**Be specific about what you want!**

Don't have anything particular in mind? [Browse our recommendation wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/w/recommendations) for some common suggestions."

2605,anime,I drew some Evangelion fanart [Evangelion: 1.11],
2606,anime,I created an AI-based anime recommendation site! It's built on over 20 million user reviews and provides personalized results,"Hello! Are you bored during quarantine and need something to watch? Looking for a better recommender system?

# Introducing [kankoku](https://www.kankoku.co)!

kankoku is an anime recommendation site that looks at anime you’ve watched and provides recommendations that go beyond simple genre or plot similarities. It’s built on over 20 million user reviews from MyAnimeList and includes most anime prior to Fall 2018.

**How does it work?**

Simply upload your anime list (from MAL) and kankoku will calculate your personalized recommendations.  (You can export your list [here](https://myanimelist.net/panel.php?go=export), and unzip it)

If you don’t use MAL or if you just want to look at a few anime, a dropdown selector has been provided as well.

[Check it out](https://www.kankoku.co)!

**How are my recommendations calculated?**

The model only looks at the ‘completed’ anime on your list, and disregards any ‘dropped’ or ‘watching’ records. These anime are then fed into an item-item collaborative filtering machine learning model, which returns a list of recommendations. Under the hood, a KNN model finds the cosine similarities of the ten nearest neighbors of each input anime, calculated based on other similar user’s reviews of those anime. Results are weighted based on your MAL scores (1-10 scale), so be sure to rate your completed anime.

Or you can just imagine Detective Conan sitting in the server room, calculating your recommendations in real-time.

**Why isn’t** *\*anime\_title*\* **in the recommendation list?**

Contrary to how other sites suggest content based on similar genres, kankoku finds similarities between anime at the user-review level. This method is similar to how Netflix pushes content, and is more accurate and effective than just looking at surface level data.

Furthermore, kankoku only looks at anime in its database – this includes most anime from mid-2018 and before. Sadly, this is a data limitation, and can only be fixed when a more recent scrape of user reviews is made available.

**How did you make this?**

kankoku is built in Python and assembled with Dash. Uploaded files are deleted upon exit, so none of your data is being stored or used for other purposes.

**Will kankoku support other sites (like Anilist) in the future?**

Sadly, the data format on other sites is different from MAL. If this was only at the export-level, it would be an easy fix, but often times entire anime titles and genres are coded differently. However, it is not out of the realm of possibilities to add this functionality, if enough interest is shown :)

**Why is an anime I've already watched in my recommendation list?**

Check if that anime is marked as 'completed' on MAL.

If yes, then it is likely due to MAL changing naming schemes a couple years back - like 'vs.' being coded as 'VS'. If you think this is the case, please comment or DM me with the problem-items, and I'll have it fixed asap.

**Issues or bugs?**

Please message me if you come across any issues – I’m relatively new to Python development, but will definitely look into any areas for improvement.

Stay inside and watch anime –

**Note to all participants**

Although I don't believe it necessitates stating, please conduct yourself appropriately and be court to your fellow participants. 

**Note to all Rewatchers**

Rewatchers, please be mindful of your fellow first-timers and tag your spoilers appropriately using the r/anime spoiler tag as so \[Spoiler Subject]\(\/s ""Spoilers go here."") in order to have your unsightly spoilers obscured like this [Spoiler Subject](/s ""Spoilers go here."") if your comment holds even the slightest of indicators as to future spoilers. Feel free to discuss future plot points behind the safe veil of a spoiler tag, or coyly and *discreetly* ‘Laugh in Rewatcher’ at our first-timers' temporary ignorance, but please ensure our first-timers are no more privy or suspicious than they were the moment they opened the day’s thread.

**Note to all First-timers:**

First-timers, be aware that you too could have unwanted influence upon others’ perception of future events, so please be careful and use a spoiler tag when disclosing any predictions or inferences that you wouldn’t have wanted to know were they to be true.

**Comment of the Day**

[\/u\/No_Rex](https://www.reddit.com/user/No_Rex) discusses the [factors](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/gql9yy/space_runaway_ideon_40th_anniversary_rewatch/frv7kgq/) that make the sub-light missiles dangerous to handle.

> It sounds crazy, but I think everything surounding the sub-light missiles makes a lot of sense (more so than any other technology around). I assume that they are dangerous because they can not be send from subspace on their own (probably because, on their own, they'd lose too much speed while exiting).

&nbsp;

**Daily Trivia:**

> Director Yoshiyuki Tomino decided to make the Ideon enormous so that it wouldn’t look quite as out-of-place next to structures and vehicles that we would have a greater frame of reference for.

&nbsp;

**Staff Highlight**

Moriyasu Taniguchi

> A veteran animator, director, and character designer with a prolific career who contributed many animation cuts to the series. Before becoming an animator, he had worked as a Nishijinori textiles designers, managing at a mannequin production company, and at commercialization for a film production company. Having debuted as an animator on the adaptation of Osamu Tezuka’s *Big X*, he was mentored at the time by Norihiro Okasako, and became a frequent animator for Toei and Sunrise in the 70s. He is said to have been struck by the design and presentation of the main character of Armored Trooper Votoms, Chirico Cuvie, which became his ideal going forward. Notable productions where he worked as an animator include *Fist of the North Star*, *Angelic Layer*, *Blue Comet SPT Layzner*, *Captain Tsubasa*, the *Cty Hunter* franchise, *Ergo Proxy*, *Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash*, *Panzer World Galient*, and *Fang of The Sun Dougram*.

2650,anime,Anyone willing to host a re-watch for the main Studio Ghibli movies? They release on HBO Max tomorrow and I am planning to watch the main ones for the first time ever!,"So I have actually never seen any of Studio Ghibli famous movies and I saw that they will be available for streaming for the first time ever in USA on HBO Max.

I was curious if anyone was willing to host a re-watch for the main movies, and looking at MAL scores the top 7 movies all have a score higher than 8.27.

Which would be: Spirited Away, Princess Mononke, Howl’s Moving Castle, Grave of the Fireflies, My Neighbor Totoro, Castle in the Sky and Kiki’s Delivery Service. I feel like these are probably the main 7 I should watch?

I know this is last minute, but I would totally get involved in a re-watch, as this would be my first time watching and I already am planning on watching these movies when HBO Max starts tomorrow.

I am open to whatever, even something like 1 movie every other day. I just like the idea of seeing live comments about these movies, as well as people who have seen them many times, incase I have any questions I want to ask!

So is anyone willing to set up some type of rewatch schedule? It can be super basic, but I just have no experience in hosting these types of things."

I have only added those battles which contain two characters that I know, without a shadow of a doubt, are from an anime or at least are from a manga. I did not include those which came from visual novel games (like DDLC), those which only have 1 anime character, or those with zero anime characters. I will include those in a reply to this post. I am trying to play it safe.

Watch these battles and more. They are cool."

2680,anime,What anime you hate with passion?,"Straight up despise. I'm not talking about ""haha 7/10 not very good"" I mean you think is complete trash, people who watch it are delusional, should've never been an anime or even manga.

No bandwagon hate but anger, frustration, rage, impotence. Give me your worst rant and insults to that anime that you loathe with your soul."
2681,anime,So what do I do now?,"Recently I finally finished the widely popular show ""Hunter X Hunter"" I started the show when I was 11 years old. A buddy of mine knew my home situation wasn't the best, he knew that I had problems making friends due to my horrible mother. I got to the heavens gate tournament arch before I had to stop watching for awhile. I went through a custody battle at 12 years old and had to tell the court about my mothers abusive tendencies, to go and live with my father. Fast forward to my 17th birthday with my girlfriend of 1 year, she mentioned to me that she was a huge fan of the show. Like any normal couple would we binge watched the show, we finished the show together and I cried...like alot😂 After watching it I had remembered the friend who'd showed me it in the first place. He was around 18 or so back when he showed it to me so I know he had probably moved around alot since. Talking to friend after friend, I got his Facebook, and while I don't really use Facebook, I got on and sent him a thank you message, talking about how much it meant to me just to have a show to put time into back then. Turns out that he had just finished watching the show with his daughter, and I think that's a pretty cool story to share"

If possible post a list of all the romance/harem animes you know of

Please make it so it redirects me to mal it would make it alot easier to go over the animes Thanks:)"
2683,anime,What is it that makes something “well-written” and vice versa to you,"I honestly find it kind of funny whenever I see someone on here saying that they disliked a show because it had “bad writing” which is such a big aspect of filmmaking that it feels more like an excuse to not have to understand or explain what your problem with it is, from my point of view at least. So if you say that a show has “bad writing”, what does this mean to you? I know that “writing” can mean so many things to different people so that’s why I’m asking.

Edit: Repost cause the latest title was shitty and didn’t ask the right question

Edit 2: Not necessarily me asking what makes for a well-written show as it is something I’d say I have a grasp on. But more what you people think makes for one. It is very subjective and I’m interested in what other people think"
2684,anime,Are the rumors about the season 3 of March comes in like a lion valid?,"There are rumors running around on twitter about a season 3, but it's more leaks than anything and I'm not gonna survive if it's actually false. Anyone care to share their opinion on the topic, and what they think about all this?"
2685,anime,Looking for anime close to a Chivalry of a failed knight style school and plot wise,I already eat used another one with the MC being a guy being able to conjure a shield in a school with other users who can summon other weapons so don’t recommend that anime if you know it

2687,anime,Looking for anime to watch,"Hey guys,

I’m looking for somewhat popular anime (doesn’t have to be) to watch that’s fits the description of: School anime with op mc that hides abilities, anime where mc hides powers until needed, anime where op mc keeps to himself but still attracts attention.

Some anime that I like that are like this are classroom of the elite and irregular at magic high school (mahouka)

Sorry if I’m being too picky. Thanks"

2692,anime,Can I get some appreciation for the music of the Anime we watch?,"An often overlooked part of a lot of the Anime we watch is the music that goes along with them. I'm not talking about just anime centered on musical themes either (e.g. Carole & Tuesday, etc) I'm talking anything! Here a couple examples of anime I think have excellent music:

1. Kaguya-Sama: Love is War 
Season 1 and 2 have such spectacular and unique openings in my opinion the jazzy feal and the solid vocals are just amazing and really stand out in my mind.

2. Steins;Gate/Steins;Gate 0
Again the opening are good but I think the main star here is just the normal score. It has a distinctive sound and tone that really sets the anime. Gate of Steiner is iconic for that franchise and is memorable, melancholy, and tension building.

3. Cowboy Bebop
An iconic opening, several good vocal tracks throughout it's run and a clear sense of atmosphere what's not to like?

Is music in anime as important as I think it's? What are some of your guys favorite soundtracks from anime?"
2693,anime,Looking for a specific Devil anime but cannot seem to remember its name.,"I am looking for an anime that has a Demon or Devil mother that can come to the human world but she only brings a portion of her power to enter the mortal plain as using all would cause destruction.

its been driving me crazy seeing that part in my head of a magic circle appearing and a young devil/demon comes out of it wanting to see her daughter.

If anyone can help bring a name to this anime that would be great.

I know its not:

High School DxD

Rosario Vampire

but do think it was a romance of some sort.

2696,anime,Sword Art Online .......,"**”If you watched SAO when you were young/a weeblet you would’ve enjoyed it. But when you have watched a good amount of shows , you’ll realise how generic and mediocre it is”**

I’m sure everyone’s heard/read this statement. 

Why is this not relatable to me ? I’ve watched so many shows (400+ according to MAL) , but I’ve never found any like SAO... 

It’s one of the few action+romance shows that keeps progressing the relationship and it’s actually a main focus. The only 2 anime that do this are Rakudai and Monogatari (I love both as much)

There’s a concept that’s nowhere to be found in anime. Tell me a show that deals with how **virtual worlds could affect the real world and it’s people** (except Accel world , cuz they are in the same world)

Call it boring or bad execution , but why does no one think twice before calling it “generic” ? That’s not what generic means ... 

The production value is also really high. You got amazing VAs , the OST is by Yuki Kajiura , and the animation is really amazing. In what sense is that “mediocre”. You can at least find 1 thing that stands out from this show

Did the words “generic” and “mediocre” lose their meaning ? Are they now just used to describe whatever show you don’t like ?

~~yeah , I’m triggered~~ 

Edit : what’s with the 4 word title rule ??"

Can anyone explain why you would dislike her ? Is it just because she's not badass enough compared to the rest of the characters ? ;-;

Edit : I have just watched Psycho Pass 1 (watching the rest of it now) , so when I read reviews and comments regarding her , everyone said how she was the most annoying out of the whole cast and her being naive was a problem too.

2745,DnD,Suckered a player into a card game with a fey and they said it was one of the tensest and funnest times they've had.,"The set up: The party just came off of their ""shopping"" episode in a town and have come back to the local inn to rest before leaving town. The bartender offers the party's bard a spot in a game being played downstairs and he says ""Well, I've got two gold to my name at the moment so maybe show me to the penny slots?"" The bartender replies that money isn't the buy in for this game.

This intrigues the bard enough to check it out. The bartender gives him a token which he uses to get past the guard for the game down stairs and he makes his way into the wine cellar. At a dimly lit table in the corner is sitting a goblin, a kenku, a kobald, and a pixie. The goblin, kobald, and kenku are all suspicious at first but the pixie happily invites the bard to sit down and explains the game to him. I go over that it's effectively texas hold 'em, each player roll 2 d13 and I roll 5 d13 in the background, reveal the first three numbers and then the last two as players make their bets. And then I explain that the wager is aspects of his character. For instance, he could wager hit dice and if he wins he'd get as many hit dice as he wagered on top of his normal ones, but would lose that number if he lost. And he could do this with anything, be it proficiencies, bardic inspirations, spell slots, even spells themselves where if he lost he would lose access to that spell but if he won I would upgrade the spell in some way.

After hearing the explanation he is very intrigued but just trepidatious enough to be hesitent. He agrees and we start the game. The players get their cards, bets are made, round and round until all the cards are turned over. By then he's wagered his Heat Metal spell, a point of dexterity, and his proficiency with performance. He's used performance and intimidation to make the kenku and the kobald fold but the goblin has wagered his courage so he calls. They flip their cards over and the bard wins. The goblin suddenly shrinks in terror and runs out of the cellar screaming and the bard now has a newly upgraded Heat Metal spell (I changed the damage die to a d10 instead of a d8), another point of dexterity bringing him up to 18, and expertise in performance. The pixie congratulates him, sits in the chair the goblin was sitting in and offers another game and the bard happily pushes back from the table, thanks everyone there, and quickly books it out of the cellar too.

Everyone said that was the perfect blend of exhilarating and terrifying and it was tense right up until the goblin showed his hand. It was super fun and I hope other DMs add it to their games. Sure it has the potential to make the player over powered but there's just as much chance to totally screw them over and it was a fantastic bit of RP."

2773,DnD,Need help with my character! I'm a beginner,"Hey, everyone.  
My best friend has been trying to get me into DnD for a while now, and I was finally convinced after playing a bit of Fire Emblem which gave me a lot of inspiration for a character that I thought would be fun.  


Problem is, I do not know how to distribute my stats for my character, how important each skill is for my chosen class and race (Tiefling Order of the Lycan Blood Hunter), and what would make sense for the theme I'm going for.  


His current random stats are 12 STR, 12 DEX, 13 CON, 13 INT, 11 WIS, 10 CHA and I have four more skill points to spend. I know STR and INT are really good for him but idk how to use all four points efficiently for him. Odd numbers have no point from what I've heard.  


I'm taking heavy inspiration from ""Fallen Male Corrin"" from Fire Emblem Heroes' physical appearance (you should look up his voice lines for context, as it may help you help me figure out what to do here), and the Hunter from Bloodborne's fighting style. My Tiefling's personality is going to be a lot more different, but his fighting style would be similar to how the Hunter or the Chosen Undead use Great Swords.  


My Tiefling is a lone mercenary as not many people trust Blood Hunters, OR Tieflings (from what I've heard), so he just sits somewhere around town, polishing and cleaning his weapons, sort of like ""advertising himself"" as a reliable and careful fighter so that people would maybe offer him jobs to take if they see past his intimidating demeanor. He's actually a very gentle and selfless person who just wants to be treated the same as everyone else, and can even be quite the romantic/romanticist when he feels completely open with himself (or if he's drunk and around a person he's interested in, or just women in general), as he tends to enjoy escaping from reality by reading books of brave heroes where they defeat the dastardly villain, and rescue their love interest.  
However, due to the circumstances of his birth and class, he has no choice but to kinda mask his true personality as not many people would actually trust him if he were to act all like that. They would think it's just an act. So, ironically, he has to make an act that he's really a dark and brooding person to hide his true personality, so that people wouldn't find him untrustworthy for acting like a unusually friendly Tiefling.  
Because of this, he's quite sad, but once the party recruits him, I'm planning to make him really pleasantly surprised that someone would actually want him to travel with them, show off his true personality for a moment but then catching himself and going back to how his ""alter-ego"" is.  


Sorry for lengthy post. I hope this was comprehensible. This is my first time with a character."
2774,DnD,I can’t use cities anymore. [5e],"In my party, there are a ranger, a druid, a bard, a sorcerer, a cleric/warlock, and a rogue. Everyone but the ranger is Chaotic, and mostly CN at that. 

Every time they’re in a crowded area, the kleptomaniac bard with +15 to Sleight of Hand finds the richest people around and robs them. The rogue gets bored pretty easily and either sleeps with the NPCs or kills people. Already, they’ve burned down a tavern with everyone inside (except for a baby whom they had their NPC monk rescue) for being racist, murdered people with no regard for their families (when they killed the bouncer outside the tavern, they found a note from his young child wishing he’s be safe), and looted the body of a child who died as a result of an enemy mage’s poorly aimed lightning. That was just one session.

At this point, they’ve accrued enough money that even a CR 15 inflation monster can’t stop them from buying any random magic stuff they can find, and I’ve already established that shops selling magic items exist in some cities.

The plan for the plot involved quite a bit of city-hopping as the players investigate diplomats from a distant nation. The problem is that cities are where the players get even more stupid-rich,  kill innocent people, and generally be Chaotic Chaotics. The only line they have yet to cross so far is killing children, which they generally dislike and avoid.

I’m trying to send the party into wilderness areas, but I can’t keep them out there forever without completely freezing the campaign’s plot. What can I do to keep them from becoming far too powerful far too fast simply by virtue of destroying things and stealing stuff? (Consequences for their Actions are already in the works. I’m looking for creative solutions.)"

2776,DnD,Lance Knight Build.,"Got my boy Ser Carth Galador. He is a Joyous a jolly Knight. He is from a land far away, and his stead Calmert is of the most loyal sort.

A lance and mounted combat would seem appropriate. But the lance doth not have great weapon, or versatility. I asked the dm himself, and he proclaimed it would be possible to craft a lance in such fashion. 

However would it be worth it? And how would opportunity attack work? If i rusheth at an enemy and hit him whilst achieving sentinel status, would that prevent him from attacking me in the same turn?

Normally my solution would be to throw something new and unexpected at them, to suddenly wrap them up in something completely different, but there’s already so much going on, I feel like I’d overwhelm them if I forced anymore story onto them. It really is best to let them choose the next step, but until that decision yields consequences and interesting story beats, I worry the players will be bored. 

It stinks, because I know there’s a lot of cool stuff right around the corner, but they have to be the ones to actually *walk around the corner.* How can I capture their eagerness to do so again?"

2782,DnD,I DMed for the 2nd time in 25 years.,"This is an update for this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/gmgpyr/dmed_last_night_for_the_first_time_in_25_years/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

To continue on, the players had lost an NPC in the first arena battle. They played out the aftermath in the cell, this including one of the other NPCs morning the loss of his brother. They tried to escape and to see if there was something in the cell they could use. The main reason they didn't get out, because the DM said so. They were on a boat and really could not go anywhere.

The next day, they were forced into another arena fight. Lost another NPC in the battle (this was scripted to happen). The NPC tried to strike back at the captors and it didn't end well. This escalated things the boat as the main villian was now getting angry for losing slaves. He knocks them unconcious with a poison gas. One player tried to hold his breath. I gave him some leeway and he was able to get a door unlocked, but due to a failed CON check, eventually passed out.

They are awoken the next day by the Villian and are threatened to not try anything. As he is talking, the boat is rammed by another one. Villian runs out to see what happens. I gave the players the freedom to try and escape, all the while it sounded like a battle was going on upstairs. After a little bit of trying, their saviours came and got them out of the cell. I really built up the sense of hopelessness before the rescue. They go to the deck of the ship and are faced by the Villian and a white dragon. Since level 1 chars would be wiped out, I had two Metalic dragons come in and save them. The party and good NPCs escape to the saviours ship. They now find out rhey are in Icewind Dale, very far from home. 

The saviours let them know they have been intercepting slave ships and that there has been an increase in their appearance. The Metalic dragons return and take humanoid shape. They inform the party that a war of dragons is coming. That they are trying to stop the chromatic dragons from gaining more power. The players agreed to help in the north. They get sent to a shop owner to get outfitted so they can continue adventuring. The prologue ended off the players sitting at the inn and looking at each other. They had been through something traumatic, but knew they could trust each other. The whole point of the prolgue, to bond the players in a different way.

One additional fun fact. The shop owner is the first character I ever made. He was based in Icewind Dale when I played him in 2nd edition. Now, he is 25 years older and an NPC. The savior party was made up of other characters that my fiends played with me. It was nice revisiting those old memories and helping those characters live on.

My plan now is to have more modular adventures inside a greater storyline. As sometimes people can't make it to the game, this will allow them to sit out, but still progress the story. Which is going to be a fight against a white dragon cult. I am going to have them find pieces of information on where to find the main enemy camp, but not until they are higher level. The dragon war will be fought on various fronts all over Faerun, but this part will focus on the north. Looking forward to the next steps."

2794,DnD,Weapon art: a complaint about 5e PHB,"I am recently getting back into D&D after playing a bit of 4e. So far I like 5e much more, however, I find the equipment section of the PHB to be particularly lacking in art in a way that the 4e PHB was not. I know it’s just a little thing but I think it was a strong point (and weak in some cases) in the 4e version. Is there anywhere online I can find an art page for weapons and armor for 5e similar to the one for 4e? I want to have the visuals to help my new players find their look. 
Thanks in advance"

2796,DnD,Joining Online Groups?,"So it's been a while since I've played D&D (5th Edition), and recently, I've really wanted to get back into it. However, I don't have a group to play with IRL, and I won't (likely) be able to find one until school starts back up. So, to fill the time between now and August, I was considering joining a group online (yes, with strangers). However, I wanted to get some opinions on this idea first. How do you guys feel about joining online groups? Is Roll 20's ""Looking for Group,"" feature solid? Can I expect a decent experience from this?

I don't use Reddit often so forgive me if I'm breaking some unwritten etiquette. Thank you in advance!"
2797,DnD,How can I make my dungeons more interesting?,"Whenever I design a dungeon I typically like to give them a unique feel, but other than that I find mine to be kind of linear, and I'd like to stay away from the whole ""go left or go right thing"" because that feels overused. I'm also really bad at making puzzles. What can I do?"
2798,DnD,Assassin go poof!,"My assassin with 2 levels in warlock just got a ""Cloak of Superior Invisibility"". I already had Devil's Eyes and Devil's Darkness. That is a lot of disappearing for me to use whenever I need too. Not to mention as a Tabaxi with expertise in stealth and acrobatics, I think i can climb/jump out of sight before I become visible again. 

My only issue is that I'm only lv 5. This seem like a lot of stuff for me to have at this level. Most of my party members don't have any magic items near my cloaks level. Should I ask my DM to nerf it to balance the party? Or should I wait and see?

ps. She is a first time DM."
2799,DnD,(DM) I got laughed at for trying to voice characters,"As the title says, I tried voicing some of the characters in Curse of Strahd and instantly my group just started laughing while I was trying my best at it. 


My group play other games while I DM and generally don't pay attention.


Other than get new friends what can I do?
Any advice is appreciated, thanks <3"

Unfortunately, it’s 100% true and it’s 1,000% awful. But we have a chance to stop it from happening. Support from tens of thousands of people across America convinced House leadership to schedule a vote on important privacy protections this Wednesday.
 
If you want to help save Internet privacy, you can visit [SaveInternetPrivacy.org](https://www.saveinternetprivacy.org/) where you can send an email to your lawmakers asking them to save Internet privacy. You can also call Nancy Pelosi’s office directly 1 (202) 930-8115 and ask her to save Internet privacy by supporting the Wyden-Daines amendment. 
 
There’s a lot of momentum behind this political movement. Tech companies like Reddit, Mozilla, and Twitter have all signed on to [an open letter](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/05/22/protecting-search-and-browsing-data-from-warrantless-access/) demanding that Congress support common-sense privacy protections. And a lot of lawmakers really want this amendment to pass. To make that happen, they need to know that this issue is very important to a lot of people just like you and me. So visit [SaveInternetPrivacy.org](https://www.saveinternetprivacy.org/) now and tell them how you feel.

I'm a guy in my late 30's. I have a wife and two young children. I have no general disabilities (though I do have some chronic medical conditions).  I've wet the bed irregularly throughout my whole life, with some dry periods, but 8 years ago I started wetting the bed regularly again, which hadn't been the case since about 3rd grade, and I had to start wearing diapers again on a daily basis.

Hi, my name is Garry Cooper and I am the CEO and Co-founder of the resource-sharing company, [Rheaply](https://www.rheaply.com/). Rheaply’s technology accelerates the circular economy by allowing organizations to share idle materials, thus promoting the reuse of assets. Our AxM platform enables companies to share and sell physical assets within and between organizations. AxM serves some of our nation’s most vital institutions: universities, biopharma and biotech companies, major technology companies, and government entities.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Rheaply has [partnered](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200522005388/en) with the City of Chicago and World Business Chicago to connect Chicago’s small businesses and nonprofits with personal protective equipment (PPE). In preparation for the reopening of the city, small organizations can use the platform to access hand sanitizer, protective shields, and face masks to protect their staff.

We also developed an adaptation of our core technology that connects healthcare providers and first responders with much-needed PPE and other critical medical supplies.

With these initiatives, we aim to address the supply shortages organizations and healthcare providers face by helping direct these supplies to the places where the need is most dire.

I'll be answering questions about supply shortages, resource reallocation, and how our technology works between 12pm CST and 3pm CST.

We met during our time at University and have worked together as a tight-knit team for the past six years. We focus on developing cozy and family-friendly games set in colorful, fantasy worlds. In 2016 we developed and released NIVA which has been downloaded over 70k times ([https://followfeathers.itch.io/niva](https://followfeathers.itch.io/niva)).  In 2018 we founded our own indie studio and have since then been working on Weaving Tides which is a Zelda-inspired adventure game where you ride carpet dragons to patch up a magical, woven world! Weaving Tides has recently been successfully funded on Kickstarter ([http://kck.st/35j7zJh](http://kck.st/35j7zJh)) and is planned to release towards the end of this year.

&#x200B;

You can ask us all kinds of questions like:

* How to found an indie game studio?
* How to get funding for a game idea?
* How we gathered interest for our games?
* How we develop the textile world of Weaving Tides?

So let’s get this started! Ask us anything!

I’ve been a Marine, a farmer, a public school teacher, a college professor, a county government official, and spent five years as a reporter and then editor of a local newspaper.

As a Marine Corps officer, I led marines and sailors in wartime and peace for over 20 years. I aided humanitarian efforts during the Somali Civil War, and I worked with our allies to shape defense plans for the Republic of Korea. My wife Lynn is also a Marine. We retired from the Marine Corps in 2005 and bought Chicken Bristle Farm, a 75-acre farm plot in Lincoln County.

Together we've raised livestock and developed the largest all-natural and sustainable asparagus operation in central Kentucky. I worked as a substitute teacher in the local school district and as a reporter and editor for the Interior Journal, the third oldest newspaper in our Commonwealth.

I have a deep appreciation, understanding, and respect for the struggles that working families and rural communities endure every day in Kentucky – the kind that only comes from living it. That's why I am running a progressive campaign here in Kentucky that focuses on economic and social justice, with a Universal Basic Income as one of my central policy proposals.

They had only just announced a very strict curation for their store so 2 days later I launched SideQuest ( sideloading on Oculus Quest ) which allows developers to get their apps into the eager hands of VR users who are starved for content. To date we are the only 3rd party content platform second only to the main store by facebook. 

Fast forward 12 months, we have exploded to 290K monthly active users and our launcher application has just passed 1 million downloads across all versions. Needless to say this is the biggest accomplishment of my life and I'm hugely proud to help push this new technology forward. 

To celebrate I spent the last week building a relaxing experience designed to help keep you from going crazy during lockdown. The game is called BlanketWorks ( shameless plug ) - https://twitter.com/SideQuestVR/status/1263534205167964162?s=19 and it lets you build blanket forts in VR with some relaxing music for free.

2921,IAmA,"We're now in 9 straight weeks of record unemployment numbers, and more than 38 million Americans have lost their jobs in that time. We are POLITICO reporters and an economist – ask us anything about the economy and current federal policy amid Covid-19.","The economic impact of the pandemic is staggering. The latest numbers on unemployment claims came out this morning: [2.4 million workers filed for unemployment last week](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/21/unemployment-claims-numbers-coronavirus-272868), which means 38.6 million Americans – about 23.4% of the workforce – have lost their jobs over the last 9 weeks as the coronavirus pandemic continues to ravage the economy.

(For some context, in normal times, the number of weekly unemployment claims usually hover around a couple hundred thousand.)

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned last weekend that [U.S. unemployment could reach a Depression-level 25%](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/17/powell-unemployment-depression-25-percent-264500). Thousands of small businesses are closed and many will remain shut for good after losing all their revenue. The stock market bottomed out in March but has recovered somewhat since then and is now down about 15% from its pre-virus high point.

What officials are trying to do to save the economy:

* Congress has raced to pass multiple rescue bills totalling around $3 trillion in federal support, but they probably still need to send more aid to state and local governments and extend extra jobless benefits.
* The Trump administration is pushing for a swift economic re-opening, but is mostly leaving the official decision-making up to the states.
* The Fed has taken extraordinary measures to rescue the economy – slashing interest rates to zero, rolling out trillions of dollars in lending programs for financial markets and taking the unprecedented step of bailing out state and city governments.

So what does this mean for the future of the U.S. economy? How will we recover and get people back to work while staying safe and healthy? Ask us anything about the current economy amid the Covid-19 crisis and what lawmakers, the Fed, the Trump administration and other groups are trying to do about it.

Born in San Francisco, California, I moved around with my parents to various states in the South until they settled in Memphis when I was nine. As the oldest child, I watched my parents struggle together to provide the best of what they could give us especially concerning education. I graduated from Bartlett High School in 1996 and received a full scholarship to the University of Tennessee where I received a Bachelor of Science in Communication in 2001.After college, I started my career at FedEx Ground in operations management where I learned the value of process improvement and servant leadership. It was also here that I met my husband, Greg. I was able to leverage my solid foundation of operations and creative problem solving into a career in business consulting and continuous improvement. We moved to Kentucky 10 years ago during the recession, and I fell in love with the state and its people.

Growing up, I was always politically aware with a uniquely inclusive perspective.  I am the child of an immigrant and veteran who as a child was thrust into the Civil Rights Movement.  I grew up with stories of activism as a family history. I grew up believing that our best leaders worked hard and respectfully to represent all of their constituents, not just the ones that voted for them nor for special interests.  I want to carry on this legacy in Congress fighting for everyday working Americans.

I’ve followed the actions and words of the current Representative of Kentucky’s 4th Congressional District. The words and actions of Thomas Massie are why I decided to run.  I’ve staked my professional career on building consensus in hard business environments. I’ve fought hard to earn a seat at many leadership tables by not going with the status quo.  I did this through the kind of relationship building and servant leadership that we deserve to have in the House of Representatives.  I could continue to be voter with a limited voice but you should know I’m not that kind of person,  I am the kind of fighter that has to stand up when I see something wrong. And right now, we need a fighter for all Kentuckians, not just the 1%. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all of us in ways we never thought possible. I have been a vocal advocate for the stimulus packages to give more direct payments to Americans, provide rent subsidies, and to stop funneling cash to wall street. This crisis has shown us we need elected officials who will stand up for everyday Americans. Stimulus packages should be bailing out the kitchen table, not the boardrooms.

One of the most important things we must change is making sure healthcare coverage is NOT tied to employment. I believe in the creation of a public option to help make healthcare affordable. The existence of healthcare advocates and rising prescription drug costs within our system demonstrates how much our sick loved ones are exploited by the current system. Kentuckians deserve more from their government. It’s time for our representation to work to meet our needs and protect us from the burgeoning threat of medical bankruptcy.

This Pandemic has created unprecedented levels of unemployment. I believe we should take a lesson from FDR’s public works projects. We can empower Americans with good jobs at a wage that can support families. We can invest in our infrastructure and allow America to be the world leader in climate-friendly 21st century infrastructure. We can no longer ignore the economic, and tragic human toll that climate change is taking on our communities and our world. The United States has always led the world through innovation, it is time for us to do so again. Along with renewable energy projects, we have to update our infrastructure to give broadband access to under served communities. We must also ensure that clean water access is available to every household.

Education is the foundation and lifeblood of our democracy and is required to sustain our republic. I believe in a fully funded public education system where our educators are treated and respected like the highly skilled professionals that they are. I believe in an education system that works to create equity in our society to combat the stereotypes and discrimination of the past. A public education system should provide the same quality education to all students, and not just those in affluent areas. Our children are our future, and our representation in Congress should work to always give them the best opportunities possible. With the Pandemic, I must ask, whose children did we leave behind? With at home learning suddenly being required, how do children without broadband access learn? Kentucky’s average connection speed is lower than what is required to sustain video conferencing. This is why I am focused on broadband being included in any infrastructure bills.

2929,IAmA,IAmA two-time heart transplant survivor and cancer survivor. Ask me anything!,"Hi Reddit! My name is Morgan, and I've had two heart transplants and Stage 4 Hodgkin's Lymphoma. I am 27 years old.

I was born with about 9 congenital heart defects that made it impossible for my heart to work on its own, so in 1993 at the age of 6 months old, I got my first heart transplant at the Colorado Children's Hospital. Little did the doctors know that that first transplanted heart was defective as well, and eventually failed. When I was about 11 years old, in 2004, I collapsed in the hallways of my elementary school and was rushed to the hospital with heart failure. I got my second heart transplant that year, and it was one of the most traumatic experiences of my life. But it saved my life, and I got to go back to school and be a relatively healthy kid until the summer of 2012.

That's when I started getting night sweats, chills, and fever. Being a particularly stubborn person, I ignored the symptoms thinking it was the flu and that it would pass. Finally, when I could barely stand, I went to my family doctor who immediately sent me to the ER. Two weeks later (after being diagnosed with everything from West Nile Virus to Mono), the doctors found a series of tumors on my heart and spine. The tumors were inoperable, so I went through 9 rounds of chemo in the fall of 2012 / spring of 2013. In April of 2013 there was no more tumors to be seen, and I continued my college education that I had started in 2011.

Nowadays, I deal with a lot of the consequences of my transplants and cancer, but the health effects haven't stopped me from pursuing my dream - becoming a licensed counselor so that I can help others through traumatic and life-changing experiences like mine.

2938,IAmA,A flood of coronavirus apps are tracking all of us. We're the MIT Technology Review team helping you keep track of them. Ask us anything!,"Technologists everywhere have been rushing to build apps, services, and systems for contact tracing: identifying and notifying all those who come in contact with a covid-19 carrier. Some are lightweight and temporary, while others are pervasive and invasive: China's system, for example, sucks up data including citizens' identity, location, and even online payment history so that local police can watch for those who break quarantine rules.
 
Opinions differ on whether these apps are just a technocratic daydream or—if done correctly—[a potentially useful supplement](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/28/1000714/five-things-to-make-contact-tracing-work-covid-pandemic-apple-google/) to manual tracing. But the reality is that these services are already rolling out, and many more are likely to come in the next few months.
 
Despite the avalanche of services, however, we know very little about them or how they could affect society. How many people will download and use them, and how widely used do they have to be in order to succeed? What data will they collect, and who is it shared with? How will that information be used in the future? Are there policies in place to prevent abuse?
 
At MIT Technology Review, we started asking these questions and found that there were not always clear answers.
 
So to help monitor this fast-evolving situation, we've gathered the information into a single place for the first time with our [Covid Tracing Tracker](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/07/1000961/launching-mittr-covid-tracing-tracker/)—a database to capture details of every significant automated contact tracing effort around the world.
 
We've been working with a range of experts to understand what we need to look at, pulling sources including government documents, announcements, and media reports, as well as talking directly to those who are making these apps to understand the technologies and policies involved.
 
Ask us anything about your country's automated contact tracing app, contact tracing more broadly, data privacy, or [how you can participate](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/07/1001354/how-to-submit-a-change-to-the-covid-tracing-tracker-project/) in this project.

Here's the publisher's blurb:
> 
> >When Franklin Roosevelt defeated Herbert Hoover in the 1932 election, they represented not only different political parties but vastly different approaches to the question of the day: How could the nation recover from the Great Depression?  
> >  
> >As historian Eric Rauchway shows in Winter War, FDR laid out coherent, far-ranging plans for the New Deal in the months prior to his inauguration. Meanwhile, still-President Hoover, worried about FDR’s abilities and afraid of the president-elect’s policies, became the first comprehensive critic of the New Deal. Thus, even before FDR took office, both the principles of the welfare state, and reaction against it, had already taken form.  
> >  
> >Winter War reveals how, in the months before the hundred days, FDR and Hoover battled over ideas and shaped the divisive politics of the twentieth century.

Ever since then, I have been involved in a large number of videogame-related activities at the university, including the organisation of lesson plans and conferences, the supervision of student projects and indie studio foundations and publications to hosting videogame art exhibitions.

It's been a pretty wild ride that I want to share with you, so ask me anything!

The AMA is going to open at 3AM EST (9AM CET) to 10AM EST (4PM CET). There is going to be a break of roughly two hours around 5AM EST (11AM CET) during which two of my students and I are hosting a mini crash course on videogame analysis for an online convention via Twitch (to which you are all kindly invited, I'll post a link as soon as possible :-)).

2956,IAmA,Hi I'm a game developper working at Ubisoft and started my own indie game studio. Ask me Anything!,"Hello!

I'm Daryl Barampanze, co-founder of Madlife Divertissement a small indie game studio that I'm running on the side of my main job. I work at Ubisoft Montréal as an online software programmer for the Assassin's Creed Brand. I have been in the industry for a couple of years now, from indies to AAA companies. Less than a year ago, I decided to start with some friends an indie game studio, outside of Ubisoft, to produce our own game. It has been and it is a rollercoaster of emotions and experiences as running a business is very different from the day-to-day job. [As of today, our little studio has reached 10 people working on the game](https://madlifegames.com/about).

I'm here with Mackly Férère-Antoine as u/sh-dz who is working as well at Ubisoft. He is an animation programmer on For Honor and also co-founder of Madlife. We will answer some of your questions as well!

Ask us all kind of questions:

\- What are the trend in the industry?

\- How to start a game studio?

\- How do we manage both work at the same time?

\- What brand of coffee I'm drinking right now?

&#x200B;

Let's start this! Ask me anything!

2958,IAmA,"IamA freelance academic writer. I write essays/papers for people taking online classes (Nursing, Education, Business, etc.) AMA.","I wanted to do this AMA for a long time, but I was nervous about how people would react. 

I'm a freelance academic writer.  I write papers/essays full-time & I've been doing it for years.  

*Does that mean she writes papers for OTHER people?*  Yes, that's what it means. Most of the work I do is for Nursing, Business Administration, or Education. 

IMO, it's okay for a busy person to hire someone to help with an online class.  But I definitely understand why some people say it's unethical.  

1. **""No, it's not okay to offer academic writing service.""** A large proportion of reddit users are college-educated so they might take offense to the idea of hiring someone to write papers. 
2. **""Yes, it's okay offer academic writing service.""** Reddit users are also shrewd and disillusioned, and they probably know higher education was corrupted already by profiteering, crazy high tuition, and crony-ism, so if you agree with that you might say you do not think it's unethical to hire an academic writer.   

When the school puts classes online, the student is more likely to hire an academic writer. The whole point of putting classes online was for the schools to save money and for corporate america to enable the rat racers to stay productive while they complete degrees.   

People in the fields of nursing or education find themselves working overtime AND they are expected to continue their education.  Same thing with a lot of people who get promoted to a management position and the company sends them to complete their business administration degree - there's not enough time.  

It's \*possible\* to do it without an online class assistant, but not if you want to get enough sleep, be available for family, perform well at work, etc.  

I  feel kind of guilty about how easy things are for me right now as an academic writer. The online class assistant industry is in high  demand.  And now we get more orders than ever because the pandemic caused more classes to be put online. I'm  also fortunate because as a freelance academic writer I can stay in my apartment where it's safe, & I  keep making money.  

AMA!   It's okay if you want to say freelance academic writers are terrible for doing other people's research for them. I used to say the same thing.

2959,IAmA,I'm a Psychotherapist. Ask me anything about Mindfulness Meditation for treating anxiety,"Disclaimer:  This post is for educational and informational purposes only and not a substitute for mental health counseling.”

A lot of my clients come to see me about anxiety and panic attacks and one of the first things I teach them is to use **Mindfulness Meditation** as a daily practice.  Starting at one minute per day (and gradually increasing as it becomes more natural), and maybe using a helpful meditation app like [Insight Timer](https://insighttimer.com/meditation-app), I ask them to focus on their breath.

Here's the important part:  when you notice your mind has wandered, non-judgmentally and with a Kind Inner Voice, return your attention to your breath.  Each time you successfully return your attention to your breath, congratulate yourself.  THIS is the skill you're trying to develop!

So many clients have told me:  ""I can't meditate, it makes me sleepy"" or ""I can't meditate, my mind is too busy with swirling thoughts"" or ""I can't meditate, focusing internally takes me to dark places.""  These are all really good points, and why I encourage people to start at **One Minute per Day**, and to only increase when meditation becomes so comfortable and natural that, at the end of the minute, they find themselves saying ""Wow, that's over already?"".

The purpose of Mindfulness Meditation in counseling (as opposed to other forms and intentions of meditative practices) is **NOT to become calm**!  The purpose is to notice when our minds have wandered off and to be able to return our attention to **the Present Moment**, using our breath as an anchor.  Allowing our minds to wander to our pasts often results in negative thought spirals, leading to Depression.  Allowing our minds to wander to the future often results in anxiety and panic attacks.  Returning our minds to the present moment permits us to have **peace and gratitude**, and to function effectively in our lives.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts on Mindfulness Meditation.

****May 15. 1300.  OK, I've been typing non-stop for 5 hours. I had no idea this topic was going to get such a reaction. I need to take a break. I will come back and I will answer your comments, but I need to step away. Thank you all SO MUCH for taking the time to reach out!***"

I enjoy traveling the world (55 countries so far) and building friendships all around it by sharing great beer. Since 1996, proud to say Stone Brewing has challenged the status quo, brewed outstanding, unique beers and poked a bit of fun at industrial big beer (and now hard seltzers) along the way!
 
The new documentary “The Beer Jesus From America” ( [Amazon Prime](https://www.amazon.com/Beer-Jesus-America-Greg-Koch/dp/B081G5W6ZT) ) chronicles my tumultuous journey to becoming the first American craft brewer to build, own and operate a brewery in Europe. The German tabloids dubbed me “Beer Jesus from America,” which isn’t a title I gravitate towards, but I suppose is understandable considering that I’ve preached the word of craft beer throughout the world for a couple decades now.  Check out the film trailer [here](https://youtu.be/9IWjaNpajP8)

My name is Todd Spoth and I am a commercial & editorial photographer that has been working full time as a freelance photographer for about 15 years. I am based in Houston, Texas, but my work takes me all over the world. Although I went to college (The University of Houston - Go Coogs!) my degrees were in political science and neuropsychology.

Photography is coincidentally the only class I have ever failed.

I grew up all over the place including spending a couple years in Paris, France during the mid-90’s however most of my youth was spent in Clear Lake City, Texas which is home to NASA’s Johnson Space Center. The Neutral Buoyancy Lab (NBL - aka the big pool where astronauts train) was right behind our home. My very first job was giving tours to visitors there via Space Center Houston. In recent years, I have had the chance to go back several times to photograph astronauts at the NBL as well as at Johnson Space Center. Back in 2016 I had the pleasure of meeting and photographing an amazing team of newly minted female astronauts training and prepping on campus at JSC. A portrait I made of 4 of them posing on the back of the Mars Exploration Rover was recently published in book called Seeing Science: How Photography Reveals the Universe (Aperture / 2019). They even let me drive it!

For the last 10 years I have been working on an on-going personal project focusing on hip hop artists and culture. I have met and photographed incredible talents from all over the genre including getting a tour into the inner-workings of TV Johnny Dang’s (aka the jeweler to the stars) personal office and showroom to spending a day with Vince Staples running around Austin, TX during SXSW for Billboard. I am known as “Uncle Todd” to more than a few rapper’s children and although I love the live musical experience, I personally am drawn to photographing the moments away from the stage and giving a window into the culture that most don’t normally get to see. I’ve been on the court with Drake, Bun B has been to my house and I’ve been golfing with Scarface.

I have photographed multiple US Presidents, multiple World Series’ and have visited the secretive and private homes of some of the world’s most well-known and controversial figures from Ted Cruz and US Navy Seal Marcus Luttrell (aka the “Lone Survivor”) to more illusive billionaires than I can count on both hands. I have been ‘slimed’ with NBA star Chris Paul for Nickelodeon, and worked with US Olympian Simone Biles on several occasions.

My job is to meet rad people and make them look awesome.

Because of the limitations on gatherings and such due to the Coronavirus, I started a Patreon with lots of exclusive content as well as 1 on 1 mentoring sessions in lieu of in-person classes. The mentorship spots are limited to 15 folks a month. Check it out at the link below if you think you might be interested and please share if you can!

**Unrelated interests:** I have been a musician, played in bands and have written/recorded my own music for far longer than I have been a photographer. I am an avid vinyl record collector, appreciator and seller and sometimes DJ on the side. I am a self-proclaimed expert in all types of slow music from emo and shoegaze to my beloved DJ Screw (RIP).

I began that job a few months ago, when I completed my PhD requirements, but did not yet undergo the formal ceremonial defense to get the title of ""doctor""... and then coronavirus happened... so I'm happy to announce it happened yesterday!  [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Andromeda321/comments/giguus/hey_thats_doctor_andromeda321_to_you_mister/) is a pic of me right after the virtual defense. :D

I wanted to celebrate a bit on Reddit because honestly, this community has meant a lot to me over the years- there were some moments in my PhD that were difficult, and I literally found myself thinking ""I *can't* be as bad at astronomy as some people claim if literally thousands of others disagree.""  And honestly, it's just so nice to come here and talk about cool stuff going on in space, and ponder things I wouldn't normally think about thanks to questions from Redditors.  I even put you guys in the acknowledgments for my thesis, so you know I'm serious.

After all that, I thought an AMA would be a great way to celebrate.  So, if you have a question about space, or getting a PhD, or anything else, ask away!

So far the response has been great, and I'm here today with my business partner and co-founder Alexander Macdonald to talk about how our new company hopes to change cycling for the better, and will be answering questions about cycling, the competitive racing and the product's at HindSight from 12pm EST.

Our technology is sunglasses with fully integrated rear-view mirrors, allowing cyclists to be significantly more aware of what's happening around them, and therefore able to make smarter decisions, and allowing competitive cyclists to be more tactical in their races.

Everyone who has tried our glasses has changed the way they cycle - they check behind them more, they are proactive on the roads instead of reactive, and each and every one of them has come to us after returning the test model saying they wished they had them for everyday use.

Give our KickStarter video a watch, and please come back with any questions!

If you like our campaign, please share it with your cycling-crazy friends (everybody knows one or two), or support us if you want.

---
Hey everyone!

My name is Samelys López, and I'm a candidate for New York's 15th Congressional District, which is entirely in the South Bronx. We've been represented by Jose Serrano for 30 years, but he's stepping down.

There are now over 12 people running in the Democratic primary on June 23, including a homophobic Republican who drove Ted Cruz around the Bronx, a City Councilmember who's taken in tens of thousands of dollars from real estate developers, and people who don't even live in the South Bronx.
I am running on a platform to center the needs of the most vulnerable first. We've often been called the poorest congressional district in the country, but we're also the home of salsa, hip hop, and the Young Lords. I'm a part of that rich history of innovation, and taking that to Washington.

While there I will fight for:
* A Homes Guarantee, ensuring that housing is a universal human right for every American
* Medicare for All, so that nobody is denied care or goes bankrupt because of illness
* A Universal Basic Income of at least $2000 a month, so that everyone is able to put food on the table
* Universal childcare, repealing the Hyde Amendment, a $15 minimum wage, a Federal Jobs Guarantee through the Green New Deal, and more

When I was a child, my family experienced homelessness, and I vowed to make sure no other little girl went through what I went through. My policies and campaign style reflect that promise. We're not taking a dime of corporate cash, and the establishment is scared. Our movement has been [endorsed](https://lopezforthepeople.com/endorsements) by New York City DSA, AOC, Tiffany Cabán, Zephyr Teachout, the Working Families Party, Sunrise NYC, and more! 

Ask me anything about my policies, running for Congress in a COVID-19 hotspot, the South Bronx, or me!

2981,IAmA,Jesse from Dollar Flight Club! I'm here to discuss the future of travel post COVID-19! AMA!,"Jesse here, Founder at Dollar Flight Club! Not to be confused with Dollar 'Fight' Club...not supposed to talk about that anyway since that's rule #1 of fight club :)

We recently released an industry report about the future of the Airfare industry in the post coronavirus world. It's been widely covered by the press over the last couple of weeks and we've been getting tons of questions about it, so thought Reddit would be a great place to answer them. I'm relatively new to Reddit and excited to be here to share/discuss the future of travel post COVID-19 with everyone.

**Background on Company:**

We help over 1 million members travel more and save $$$ on international and domestic flights. Dollar Flight Club has been around for more than 3 years and here's some proof that a few people find what we do and say useful :) Recent Media: [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/future-travel-bookings-pandemic/index.html), [Conde Nast Traveler](https://www.cntraveler.com/story/what-to-consider-before-you-cancel-your-flight), [AFAR Magazine](https://www.afar.com/magazine/top-trending-destinations-with-the-best-airfares-deals-in-2020) [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jqlouise/2019/11/01/dollar-flight-club-launches-business-and-first-class-deals/#34633aa363c2), [Fodors](https://www.fodors.com/news/photos/whats-flying-going-to-be-like-post-pandemic), and [The Points Guy](https://thepointsguy.com/news/dollar-flight-club-premium-plus/) to name a few.

Our team focuses on international and domestic flight deals from and within the United States. We also serve international deals from departure airports in Europe, South America, and Australia.

&#x200B;

**Industry Report:**

Late last month, we put together detailed studies on the [COVID-19 impact on the airline industry and airfare prices](https://dollarflightclub.com/industry_reports/covid-19-impact-on-the-airfare-industry-in-2020-and-beyond/) based on data from post 9/11 and the Great Recession as well as the [Impact on Consumer Travel Demand](https://dollarflightclub.com/industry_reports/covid-19-impact-on-travel-demand-in-2020-and-into-the-future) where we surveyed 20,000 of our 1 million members.

Here are some high-level takeaways:

&#x200B;

* Airfare prices will decrease by 35% on average through 2021 and then sharply increase 27% on average (above 2019 levels) through 2025 as demand rebounds.
* Two major US carriers will merge in 2021, further consolidating control of the market.
* Even though facing fewer flight options, travelers will benefit from less flight delays and cancellations.
* Over 40% of travelers will only travel domestically through the end of 2020 due to the outbreak.
* The #1 domestic destination for Christmas/NYE travel is Hawaii.
* The #1 international destination for Christmas/NYE travel is Paris.
* much more...

&#x200B;

Before we get started, I want to make it clear that I'm definitely not here to condone travel until it's absolutely safe to do so. Rather, I'm here to discuss the future of travel or anything travel-related you have on your mind.

I can’t wait to answer your questions on the studies and discuss live with the help of my Dollar Flight Club team, starting around 10am PST!

Stay safe!

2982,IAmA,I’m a sustainable energy activist who was recently promoted to the System Protection Engineering Department at one of the nation’s largest electric utilities. AMA!,"Hello, my name is Ricardo Rangel. I am a sustainable energy activist and an Associate Protection Engineer at one of the nation’s largest electric utilities. My long-term goal is to help solve the major challenges transitioning to 100% renewable energy. As I sought a career path, it seemed the best position was within the electric utility since 100% renewable energy will require transforming the physical infrastructure and operational power flow of the electric grid.

Design Engineer was my first position in the industry where I was responsible for developing construction packages for new substation equipment. With a recent promotion to Associate Protection Engineer, my new job responsibilities are to calculate relay settings for transmission protection systems. System Protection is considered the most technically challenging and prestigious group within the company. System Protection is an integral part of keeping the complex transmission grid together, and the experience I will gain is absolutely critical to achieving my long-term goal.

My colleagues say renewable energy is a challenge in protection systems. Solving these problems may require a paradigm shift in many areas including protection systems. My goal is to lead the effort to find solutions and advocate for sustainable energy. AMA!

My goal is to bring the light and language of Recovery to the world and share my experience strength and Hope. I come from generational addiction.  My mother died of alcoholism when I was six. The impression she left in my life inspired me to reach out to women who suffer from addiction and women with children. I wanted to help bridge the gap from troubled lives and help women become independent and self-sufficient. Today, my dream has become a reality with Mary Hall Freedom House (MHFH), named in memory of my mother. Through a community of sisterhood, I coach women to free themselves from the past and live every day for the future. Over 10,000 women and children have achieved recovery through Mary Hall Freedom House since founded in 1996, by empowering them to end the cycle of generational addiction, poverty, and homelessness.

In the film, I share how the death of my mother Mary due to alcoholism complications launched my journey of self-discovery.

The film is on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B083VPRSWD/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl).

2984,IAmA,I dropped out of MIT and started a college. AMA about how colleges are handling the pandemic!,"[Proof](https://www.facebook.com/makeschool/posts/1673959346078508). TL;DR I dropped out of MIT and started a college called [Make School](http://www.makeschool.com). It's the college I wished existed - we offer an accredited, project-based bachelors in applied computer science where you don't have to pay if you're unemployed after graduating. Ordinarily we operate out of a campus in downtown San Francisco but have been operating online since early March. 



I did [an AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/d9c1mg/i_dropped_out_of_mit_and_started_a_new_college_in/) last fall and most of the questions focused on our no job = no pay model, how legit we actually are, and why a student would ever consider coming to Make School instead of a traditional college.

Since then, the entire calculus behind college choice has changed as colleges have moved online and vary in how prepared they are for the fall. To put it mildly, a lot of students are having sub-par experiences and a lot of colleges may close or significantly cut their offerings over the next few months. It isn't pretty. 

I've had a front-row seat into how colleges are handling the shift online. I'm hearing a lot of students wondering whether they should even go to college this fall, how much is reasonable to go into debt if they do, and how even to go about making those decisions when the future is uncertain.

Whether you've got questions about what it was like starting a college as a college dropout, how colleges are shifting online, or you want advice on your personal situation - AMA!

I also have specific training in critical care, and several years of experience as an EMS educator.

Please ask away. I hope to answer many questions and enlighten people on what the EMTs and Paramedics out there do.

(I welcome COVID response questions, but also encourage non-COVID questions to keep the discussion interesting.)

A few disclaimers:
- I'll do my best to answer all questions, but because everywhere is a little different, I may not be able to answer a question if it's specific to the EMS agency where you live.
- I'm a paramedic, nothing special about me on that scale. There are undoubtedly other paramedics and EMTs here that may poke their heads in. Please welcome their input as well.
- I will not answer questions such as ""what's the worst thing you've ever seen"" or questions like it looking for gory stories. It's considered disrespectful to ask an EMT/Paramedic/Firefighter/etc that because it's asking us to rehash our worst nightmare. Also, most people don't really want the real answer.

2991,IAmA,IamA bored pianist in quarantined who will take songs you love and butcher them in different styles AM(to play)A!,"Hi all,

So like most musicians, every gig and project I was working on got cancelled and I'm stuck in NYC bored out of my mind. 
I do a lot of improvisation and love taking songs and play them in a whole new style, but I could use some suggestions. 

So, if you ever wanted to hear Sweet Child of Mine played as a corny Bossa Nova elevator music style, or Mr. Brightside as a heart wrenching ballad, that means you're as bored as I am and I love it! 

[Here's a ragtime version of the Mortal Combat Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNLsHglMJxM) request I got last time I did an AMA, 7 years ago.

The app is a fast-paced arcade game where you match shapes, It'll be linked below with some keys if you want to give it a play.

Hopefully someone wants insight on the process of publishing an app, building a game, or even just my shoe size. It really is ""easy"" enough to do in a few months!

My name is Thomas A. Olsen and I work as a museum educator and storyteller specializing in the viking age.

My home base is Fotevikens Museum in Sweden but I also travel all over Europe to tell stories.

These days I'm pretty much stuck to trying to tell my stories on YouTube so I thought I would do an AMA for you guys.

Ask me absolutely anything you want. As a storyteller I will warn you that everything I tell you is the truth and some of it has also happened.

I'll be here for the next two hours, then on and off after that. Ask me anything! I'll try to answer as many Qs as I can.

I would also love to let everyone know about the online benefit performance of my comedy HATE MAIL, co-written with Kira Obolensky, tomorrow night.

I'm incredibly excited about the cast: **RHEA SEEHORN** of TV's *BETTER CALL SAUL* and **PAUL F. TOMPKINS** of *BOJACK HORSEMAN*, *MR. SHOW*, etc., comedy and podcast legend in general.  I've been lucky enough to work with both of these wonderful performers in the past and I'm so so grateful they've agreed to do this. Based on seeing our one (one!) rehearsal, they are going to be amazing together.  Here's where to get tickets:

[https://hatemail.simpletix.com/e/53553](https://hatemail.simpletix.com/e/53553)

About the play: HATE MAIL was written about 20 years ago, starting as a sort of parody of the popular theater piece LOVE LETTERS.  It was meant to be performed likewise, just two actors with a simple set reading correspondence. The play has had a really nice life in theaters for the past two decades and it just seemed like a natural fit for these days of pandemic-y online performances.

ALL proceeds from the play will go to **PARTNERS IN HEALTH**, a great non-profit organization dedicated to getting medical health and supplies to those who need it most.  And their specific focus on the Coronavirus pandemic has been excellent:

[https://www.pih.org/coronavirus-response](https://www.pih.org/coronavirus-response)

All that said! Please ask away. I'll be there answering away until about 1 pm eastern, 10 am pacific but will stop by as much as possible to answer Qs for a few hours after that too.  Looking forward to this!

**\[ADDED SEVERAL HOURS LATER:**  Thank you all!  I got to as many questions as I could and I'll stop by for a bit in a few hours, to see if I can or should answer a few more.  FWIW I tended to skip past questions where I'd already answered something very similar and / or where multiple-part questions made it tough to handle right now. Will be back later, but if your Q fits that bill and I haven't gotten there yet, that might be why.  Cheers, more soon..\]"
2997,IAmA,I am a cruise ship worker currently trapped at sea. AMA!,"**My short bio:** I have worked at sea for a few years now, and was unlucky enough to be at sea when all of the 'rona started. I have not set foot on land since March 14th. 

I worked for the cruise company Holland America Line as part of the entertainment team. My ship has been fighting for weeks with the CDC and the US government to let me back into the country, even though I am a US citizen. I'm happy to answer any questions here about what it's like to be at sea for extended periods of time, or what it's like to work at sea in general.

[An article about me](https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2020/04/28/coronavirus-holland-america-oosterdam-cruise-ship-stranded-at-sea/)

EDIT: ANSWERS TO COMMON QUESTIONS

* Am I being paid? No.

* Have you filed for unemployment? My internet is not strong enough yet. I'm going to try as soon as I get back on land.

* Is anyone onboard sick? No. Or at least, they have not made any announcements about that. Everyone is getting fever tested twice a day.

* How's the food? A bit lower than guest quality, but generally good. [Here's a picture of dinner!](https://imgur.com/a/nFjZoOm) 

* How do you get food? They deliver it to me three meals a day.

* How's the room? It is a 200sq ft cabin to myself. I spend around 20+ hours a day in here alone. I have a balcony and a double bed. [Here's a picture](https://imgur.com/a/hjwOymp)

* How much is the internet? it's $10 per gigabyte, and the connection is extremely spotty. It drops out usually every 20 and 30 minutes for me, and takes a few minutes to pick back up again. Even phone calls over WhatsApp are hard to make.

* Why don't you jump? It is incredibly dangerous to jump overboard a moving ship. If you jump over the side, there is a good chance that the current drags you underneath the ship and into the propellers. If you jump over the back, the water is heavily aerated and you will get sucked under again. If you manage to swim to the top / hold your breath long enough, you will die of dehydration and exposure if you don't make it to land.

* What happened when you tried to leave the ship? [longer comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/gfc3p7/i_am_a_cruise_ship_worker_currently_trapped_at/fpt5vfl)

Edit: the current plan is for me to disembark tomorrow in Los Angeles. However, that was the plan more than a week ago too. I don't have flight details or anything yet. We'll see!

Edit2: I should theoretically be disembarking tomorrow! That being said, I have answered literally hundreds of questions. I am sorry if I missed yours, though I skipped some that were frequent repeats. I will continue answering tonight and tomorrow!

Edit 3: it is tomorrow and we are docked in Los Angeles! I still won't believe I am on land until my feet hit the ground. Other crew got as far as getting to the airport, before they were forced to turn back to the ship. If that happens to me, I will riot^just^kidding^iftheshipisreading

2998,IAmA,"I am 29/f and I'm anosmic (meaning I've never been able to smell), AMA","**Some context**: I have a rare hormone disorder called Kallmann Syndrome (which affects 1 in 40,000 women and 1 in 10,000 men). Among other traits - some specific to men, and most of which I don't exhibit i.e. cleft palate and kidney loss - the main factors are delayed puberty (treated with HRT) and congenital (from birth) anosmia (untreatable and irreversible lack of smell).

While ""anosmia"" or ""hyposmia"" (reduced ability to smell) can be treated in some cases, mine will never be and is caused by underdeveloped olfactory nodes.

Feel free to AMA about anosmia or KS, or tell me something weird about smell that I may have never realised.

Hard to prove a lack of smell, that would be why my mum didn't believe me until I was eighteen, but I did make a video about this a few years ago and it got a few comments from other anosmics: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejjox-JOGSo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejjox-JOGSo)"

### /r/buildapc is recruiting - apply to join the modteam

Hi all, we’re looking for a couple of new moderators to join us on /r/buildapc to help ensure the smooth running of the subreddit and [discord server](http://discord.gg/buildapc). If unpaid, underappreciated internet busywork is your idea of a good time, then read on.

On the subreddit, you’ll be helping us to stay on top of the moderation queue, responding to modmail queries and generally making sure users aren’t murdering each other over their choice of CPU cooler. The responsibilities are more or less the same for discord mods, only in real time.

We don’t necessarily expect an encyclopaedic knowledge of PC building, but are looking for users with a bit of composure and a history of positive, helpful contributions across this kind of community.

The only requirements are 2FA enabled reddit and discord accounts. Pay is competitive with other subreddits (that is to say non-existent).

To apply, simply fill out the form below before June 5. We will be in touch via reddit DM, so keep an eye out.

[Apply here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc7VSZ0KCmqhhVH6KD6jfWnZ7utz7eeTRLwU6hxGGyZIDvlcg/viewform?usp=sf\_link)

3109,buildapc,Smell coming from newly-built pc,"Sunday I finished building my first pc. First boot everything works, all the fans are working, stuff was lighting up, etc etc. It worked.

It still does, but yesterday I started to notice a weird smell coming from it. I could smell it in the whole room.   It doesn't have a ""light"" smell like chlorine. It has a heavy smell, maybe a bit like something is burning (rubber?). So I decided to turn it off, switch the PSU off and unplug it. 

I checked the motherboard but it all looked normal from what I can tell. No burn marks, nothing. All the fans are still working. But I did find out that I accdentally routed a cable under the VRM heatsink, so I rerouted the cable and tried booting it up again. 

The smell is still there. I checked the GPU temps but those are all fine. My CPU shouldn't be overheating because it has an overkill cooler and I applied enough thermal paste (maybe a tiny bit too much, but nothing major). 

The smell is at its worst at the rear and top exhaust fans. I made sure to smell the PSU as well but it doesn't have a  very noticable smell, not like the smell I smelled yesterday.

Can somone please tell me what might be going on? Is this just a ""new pc"" smell? What can I do to make sure it's not something bad?

CPU-Ryzen 5 3600 

CPU Cooler-Arctic Freezer 34 Esports Duo Edition 

GPU-GTX 1080 Founders Edition 

RAM-16gb G.Skill Trident Z RGB 3600mhz 

Motherboard-MSI B450 Gaming Plus Max 

Storage-500gb XPG SX8200 Pro NVMe &amp;amp;amp;
1tb Seagate Barracuda HDD 

Case-Phanteks P400S (2 120mm fans) 

Fans-4 Total (3 120mm) (1 140mm) BeQuiet Pure Wings 2 

PSU-Corsair RM750X 

2 PWM Fan splitters 

Can’t wait to put it to use! Going to start making advertisement videos with it and see where it goes. Thank you all for the amazing community!!"
3112,buildapc,Ryzen 3700X Idling at 50C?,"I upgraded my build yesterday, swapped out my old i5-4570 for a new Ryzen 3700X and the Asus Strix B450 f motherboard. 
  
I booted it up today and noticed that HardwareMonitor says that the 3700X is idling at 47-50 degrees, that is way over the 26-30 C idle temp of my 4570. I already checked heat sink mounting and BIOS fan settings and nothing seems to be out of ordinary. The only thing I can think of is that I have some leftover settings that's taxing the CPU, but I'm out of ideas."
3113,buildapc,Full Rebuild with i7-10700K and ASUS Z490-A drivers not installing,"###Troubleshooting Help:

**What is your parts list? [Consider formatting your parts list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp)**

Intel i7-10700K

ASUS Prime Z490-A

Corsair 16GB 2x8 D4 3200

EVGA RTX2070 SUPER FTW3 ULT 8GB

Samsung 970 EVO m.2 NVME

850 W PS



**Describe your problem. List any error messages and symptoms. Be descriptive.**

As of yesterday, I did an upgrade/rebuild using the parts above. I was able to post, install windows, and begin updating drivers. 

The disk that came with the motherboard had several drivers, including the chipset driver, network, realtek audio and a few others. When attempting to install these drivers from the disk, it was able to install the intel chipset driver, and it would go through each of the others as if it was installing them, but after ""installation complete: restart computer"", the other drivers are not installed. Because of this, I cannot use my network.

**List anything you've done in attempt to diagnose or fix the problem.**

To fix the problem, I went to the motherboards website and downloaded the newest version of all these drivers. When copying them over and running them, the drivers still are not being installed.

I also went to intel's website and downloaded the drivers to update the Intel network I225V drivers. When running this, it says no intel network devices were found.

I tried flashing the newest BIOS version of the ASUS Z490-A also, which didn't seem to help either.

In windows device manager under other devices, it shows the network and various PCIe drivers not being installed and thus can't use them. I borrowed a USB wireless network device, got connected to the internet, and attempted to use windows automatic driver search function, but this also wasn't able to install the drivers.

**Post relevant photos of build/parts here.**

Replace this text with your answer.

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

With this being relatively new parts, I can't seem to find any information on solving this, so my new build is just a paperweight right now. Any information would be greatly appreciated!"

[The PC I want to buy,](https://nl.pcpartpicker.com/list/y4tczN) is there anything i should change or where to save some money if possible? 

I will be using this PC for gaming (Warzone, Valorant, CS GO, Fortnite Etc.) and schoolwork. All games will be played on competitive settings.

3118,buildapc,"Board won't post, feel like I've tried everything. Please save me!","OK, I'm in the build from hell. 

Currently, I can get everything on the board to power up but get no video and a VGA Debug light.

I've tried:

- RMAing the Ryzen 3700x
- two different sets of RAM
- Two different GPUs (borrowed a friend's)
- two different power supplies
- this is my second MOBO

I have confirmed the GPU and ram work in another system

I have tried seating the ram in every possible way, going one stick at a time in each slot just in case

I have tried moving the GPU to multiple different PCie slots

I have tried assembling the system both in and outside of a case just to check the grounding

I have unplugged and replugged, and re-seated every component no less than half a dozen times

The Mobo does say ""Ryzen 3000 ready"" on the box so it shouldn't be a ""flashing the bios"" issue

both the 8 pin, and 24 pin power connectors are connected and I get lights and fans, just no video + the debug light

I have tried multiple cables and multiple monitors, both of which work with my other system

I've scoured the internet high and low, and am feeling incredibly frustrated. Someone please rescue me and tell me what dumb mistake I'm making

edit: also I've cleared the CMOS both with the button on the board, and by removing the battery at least half a dozen times between re-seatings.

and also have tried plugging HDMI into both the GPU and board just in case (should be GPU but im to the point of trying everything but voodoo)

3120,buildapc,Is my GPU okay?,"Hi I just built a PC a few weeks ago and everything runs fine but sometimes I get random crashes while gaming, and I have occasionally gotten a few full computer crashes that go to the Windows blue screen with errors ""CRITICAL\_PROCESS\_DIED"", “Kernel_security_check_failure”, and one more that had to do with my RAM.

Oh also, my audio will stutter pretty frequently while playing games, but this doesn’t always lead to a crash. 

I am fairly sure my problem lies with my GPU but I’m not really sure what to do about it. I have tried DDU and readjusting my nvidia settings, but the problem persists. I have tried benchmarks and everything seems fine. 

My specs are:

CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 2700X

GPU: Nvidia RTX 2070S (Super)

SSD: Samsung 970 Evo NVMe PCIe M.2 1TB

RAM: Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4 3600 C18 2x8GB

MBD: MSI B450 GAMING PRO CARBON AC (MS-7B85)

PSU: Corsair cx650m 

I am running this on two monitors, both 1080, one is 144hz and the other is 60hz. I have tried with just my 144hz, but still got crashes. Could a bad DisplayPort cable cause issues like this?

I may try a clean windows install if it keeps happening. 

Any help would be really appreciated."

I don't mind doing tech support for this person - they are the kind of person that will just turn it off until I come around if it's not working, no big deal. They are generally really low-key and just happy to have something that works some of the time. 

They would like: 

* email
* facebook
* netflix/other media
* skype

That's pretty much it. I'm also considering adding some apps that may assist with cognitive function, but the main thing is: 

**What can I do to make this easier on them while using it?** 

I'm trying to think of ways to lock it down a bit, to prevent problems, and also ways to make it easier to read (beyond scaling, already there). Also, anything that optimizes for a senior citizen would be great!

I currently have 2x4GB sticks of DDR4 RAM at 3000MHz but am aware that 16GB is generally considered the standard amount now.

3130,buildapc,First-time build temp issue?,"Hey guys, first-time builder here - I recently put together a build and have been tinkering with various settings, but I'm seeing my idle core temperatures \~94C. 

The goal was to play / stream league of legends & play star citizen, with various other games mixed in but of less importance. Currently, I can run league of legends on about medium settings at about 60-100fps, with occasional chop. Star citizen is an entirely different story. I can run it at about 9-24fps depending on population density and activity. While trying to optimize my system for SC I found that my processor was running at about 80-95C IDLE.  CPU utilization seems way too low and is around 10% during gaming. 

I guess I have a few questions: 

1. Am I at risk running at these temperatures for long periods of time? 
2. Do these parts look like a processing bottleneck to the veteran eye? 
3. Should I *do* anything? or continue gaming and hope for the best?

3144,buildapc,First AMD build - mobo navigation,"Hey all, while I've built a PC before and know my way around the computer fairly well, I've decided to try building my first all-in AMD rig.  
It'll be multi-purpose - mostly browsing online, light gaming (no FPS, but more Dwarf Fortress, Don't Starve, Oxygen Not Included, Fallout 3, WoW maybe, Total War: Warhammer, and Crusader Kinds, etc), and video streaming.

Trying to fit into a decent budget, I've decided on monitor, cpu, and gpu for what I believe (and correct me if I'm wrong) is the better balance of price/ performance for me.

Just trying to figure out the best mobo for what I have going now.... I've heard that I'll need to look out for BIOS flashback, take into account VRM, & PCI-e 4.0, etc etc.  Coming from a tech & video post-production background, it's always my first instinct to get bigger/ better, but as I've changed careers to cybersecurity (& I'm poor from the schooling), I don't think I'll necessarily require anything so hefty - especially if it can save me money and I won't really see/ notice much of a difference in performance.

I'm debating on whether or not to go mATX for the smaller form factor (not much space for things) OR go case-less ATX & mount it on my wall (which will also save on space).

Preferably looking for two m.2 nvme slots so I can dual boot Win10 & Linux.  Space for a 2.5 SSD would also be great for my media storage, but I can always get a dock for my drives...

3154,buildapc,Fan Always Running at Full,"After a couple months playing around with my new build I updated my BIOS and reinstalled Windows 10 to get a clean slate. But now the system fan runs at full speed all the time, even when the computer is at idle. Even when I’m sitting in the BIOS doing nothing it’s running at a full 1300 RPM. It doesn’t make sense because I set the same custom fan curve I did during my last install. Even worse, changing fan settings in the BIOS doesn’t change the fan’s behavior in any way now. The RPM is the same whether the BIOS fan controls are set to Full Speed or my manually drawn custom fan curve. 1300 RPM at all times.

The only time this changes is during boot. When the computer first boots the fan goes to full. It dips to near silent when the Windows logo first pops up, and then it goes back up to full again. Those couple seconds are the only time the fan isn’t running at full. Any advice on what might be causing the problem or how to troubleshoot this?

And for what it’s worth, I don’t have any fan control software installed in Windows because, from what I read on here, my motherboard manufacturer (Gigabyte)’s software for that is garbage.

3158,buildapc,2ND monitor advice,"Hey People,

&#x200B;

I am looking to buy a second monitor replacing my current monitor to game on ( Samsung curved Full HD 24inch cf390) as the primary.  The samsung will be my secundary one. 

I thnk I am looking for a 144hz monitor. But does it matter if I take a 1440p or 1080p monitor. Also does it make a difference if one is 24? and one is 27 inch?

&#x200B;

Any onther stuff i should look out for? 

My specs:

Intel 6700

RAM: 16GB 3000mhz

GPU: 1070"

I need to upgrade my ram from 8gb to 16gb.
But the ram im using is out of stock or may be discontinued
So can i install HyperX Fury DDR4 8gb 2400MHz CL15 or Different Brand Like Corsair 8gb LPX DDR4 PC4-19200 2400MHz

Motherboard - Gigabyte B360M DS3H
CPU - Intel i5-8400

Thanks in Advance"
3160,buildapc,RAM upgrade.,My friend needed better RAM and I have some extra money so I figured why not sell my current set to him and use that money and save some in a sense and buy a better more future proof set for myself. I plan on taking this computer to college and will probably run some hefty programs so I want to get 32gb. Is CL16 ram really that much better than CL18 (about a $30 difference I think). Also what speed should I get. I plan on working a ton this summer and getting a newer better GPU from my R5 1600 to a 3700x or maybe better. Should I go straight to 3600 or is like 3200 enough?
3161,buildapc,"Is it just me, or is there somewhat of a PSU shortage at the moment?","Hey guys,

So I've been looking around trying to find a semi-decent PSU that is less than 600w to use as part of a Minecraft server PC build - I've had no issues finding most of the parts I'm after for decent prices (well, at least, decent prices considering the current circumstances...), but the PSU is eluding me.

I don't know if it's just me, or just in the UK or something, but it seems that most PSU's at the moment are either unavailable or ""item has not been released"" (which can't be true, as most of these PSU's have been out for years) on Amazon.

Here are some examples:

It's only once you start to get to PSU's that are over £80 (which is to much for a budget server build in my opinion) that you start to find some in stock, like this [Seasonic Focus GX 550W](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07WQYM74W?tag=pcp0f-21&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1).

So, has anyone else found this, especially when looking at budget PSU's? Why is it out of all components, that PSU's seem to be the only ones widely out of stock?"

3164,buildapc,How should I dedicate SSDs for a dual boot video editing PC / Hackintosh in terms of speed & heat dissipation?,"Hi all, this is the build I'm going for: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/hnRpL2 My goal is to rebuild in a Ghost S1 whenever I can get one so I can travel with it more easily.

And according to [Puget Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7zI7MYSY_0&t=39s), the ideal setup would be 3 drives - OS, Media Files, Scratch Disk. Now, the mobo I have has one NVMe slot with a great heatsink - it takes off almost 20C under load from what I've seen. So I can assume that the 2nd NVMe slot on the bottom will be really hot because it has no heatsink and is sandwiched between the mobo and the metal of the case.

From what I can estimate, 1-2TB should be enough for Media, 500GB-1TB should be enough for a Scratch Disk, and I need at least 500GB for MacOS to allow for certain DropBox folders to download. 

Is my best option to have two 2.5"" SSD's as my boot drives, 1 main NVME formatted as ExFat for Media + the occasional PC game I might install, a second ExFat NVMe in the back slot as a Scratch Disk? 

Additionally, could I reduce the number of 2.5"" SSD's to just one that is partitioned to dual boot and would that affect performance?"
3165,buildapc,New build for 144hz 1080,"I play a lot of esports titles that don't require heavy graphical settings. A few notes before you check it out:
The 1660ti is barely more expensive than the super, so makes sense to go for that.
I do plan on upgrading to a 3000 series gpu at some point, and perhaps ryzen 4000 so would I be better off getting an x570 board instead? 
I already have an HDD so i just threw a random one in there.

3166,buildapc,Should I take GTX 1660 Super (260€) or RX 5600 XT (299€) ?,"I made a post not so long ago if I should take the GTX 1660 Super or the RX 5600 XT but some things changed. First of all, I wanna build a 75Hz rig and I wanna keep it for next gen games. I have two choices for the GPU : the Sapphire RX 5600 XT Pulse and the Gigabyte GTX 1660 Super Gaming OC. Here are my specs :

I'm hesitating between the Gigabyte GTX 1660 Super and the RX 5600 XT.

The GTX 1660 Super costs 260€ and the RX 5600 XT 299€. My monitor has Freesync but only with HDMI, meaning that Nvidia can't support G-Sync. The RX 5600 XT outperforms the GTX 1660 Super, but the drivers of the RX 5600 XT are a hit or miss. The GTX 1660 Super, however, has stable drivers, but I'm afraid it can't keep up 75FPS on next gen games. AMD has not so good OpenGL support, which is still used on certain emulators, but Nvidia has good OpenGL and Vulkan support.

So, which card should I get ?"
3167,buildapc,Putting together a ~$2000 build for a friend. Can I get some second opinions? Haven't put a build together in around 4 years,"https://pcpartpicker.com/user/swirle13/saved/#view=9HmcTW

My friend is looking to put together a build including monitor, mouse, and keyboard for about $2000. He expressed interest in 1440p 144hz and mostly gaming uses but also photography and normal computer uses. He was fine with the ~$2200 price point given the performance he'll be getting.

He's also going for a mostly black/white case with no/minimal RGB. 

I chose the 3600 to pair with the 2080s because higher resolution gaming is more GPU dependent than CPU and the 3600 is really strong still. I chose the cheapest AM4 X570 mobo so he can drop in a better CPU in the future if he chooses as well as having 4 DIMM slots if he wants to expand as well. He won't be needing wifi and will be using ethernet. This could be swapped for a 10400 and a comparable mobo if it makes sense.

I chose an NVME 1TB SSD so it's very fast, and I know it's QLC so it's not going to be great for moving large files but since he's never had a PC, he won't have anything to migrate and his use case doesn't seem to require large file transfers. I want him to experience NVME speeds for his first PC ever. 

2TB Seagate HDD for mass storage. Filled by parametric filter, so no reason for it in particular.

PSU was just a solid 750W one for a reasonable price, but not tied to anything about it in particular either.

Let me know any questions about parts or anything, thanks"
3168,buildapc,"I want to start my first build, but i’m young and don’t know where to start","Hi everyone! i found this sub today and it’s perfect timing. i really want to start my first proper pc build, because i’ve been using my school laptop and it’s really not meant to run games. 
i mostly play minecraft but i would also like for it to be able to run fortnite(for my brother) and the sims 4 cause neither of them will run on my current laptop. i would also like to be able to play new games and stuff i can find on steam. 
only issues is, i am currently too young to get a job due to my age (i will be able to in january), and i’m unsure if any will be available due to the current events. 
does anyone have any tips on good starter equipment that isn’t too expensive? should i build myself or should i buy it outright? can i get away without buying certain pieces at the start, without it running badly?
i live in Ireland, so places that ship there or the UK only preferably. 
if anyone needs more detail, they can pm me :)"
3169,buildapc,Looking for monitor recommendation,"I'm looking to buy a monitor around 27"". It would mainly be used for reading documents and watching movies. Not really for gaming so refresh rate isn't important. I'm guessing an IPS would be best. I've got mixed advice on 4K (or 2K), some say it's pointless while others say it makes the text appear sharper? Would features like LED or HDR make a difference? From what I've seen you can get an affordable monitor with a few of these things, but to get certain combinations (like high refresh rate and 4k) it's really expensive. My budget is $300-$500 CAD.

Any specific suggestions or general advice?"
3170,buildapc,I don't know what GPU to upgrade to...,"Right now I have a GTX 1050 Ti, an intel i-3 8100, 8GB of RAM.

I want to upgrade my rig and I think I'll go with a GTX 1660 SUPER first, then CPU, then RAM...

So I was looking at the prices for a 1660 super and they range from 200 to sometimes 400 dollars.

Could someone help me choose what one to buy?

Thanks in advance!

3173,buildapc,First PC,Do all AMD processors come with thermal paste on the bottom of the fan ?
3174,buildapc,What do you use SATA ports for?,"I'm just curious if there's additional peripheral usage I'm missing. Most Mobos seem to come with 6 SATA ports as standard, but I don't think I've ever seen people strongly recommending 6 internal hard-drives in a build. Years ago one might have been occupied by an optical drive but they're barely used these days. I know some boards have M.2 space that closes off two SATA ports too, but in general it seems like there's usually an unused abundence of SATA ports.

&#x200B;

I'm just curious what people use them for. I like getting the absolute most out of anything I use/do, so discovering something I hadn't thought to include would be nice."

Power and reset buttons are working and the power LED is working as well. However, the HDD LED is dark. But when I connect the HDD LED cable to the POWR_LED pins on the mobo, the HDD LED lights up. I don't see anything on the mobo that could indicate that it's broken or whatever, all the pins are there, nothing is bent. I know it's not a big deal, but I just want things to work fine on my new PC."

3183,buildapc,A good motherboard you should check out,"I have been looking through a lot of posts about motherboards for ryzen 3600, 3600x, and 3700x and everybody keeps recommending the tomahawk and while it’s a great board there’s another motherboard from msi that has nearly identical vrms but lacks a usb c port and that is the b450 gaming plus which in my area is only $10 less than the tomahawk but in some areas it might be even cheaper. Some people don’t like the minor red accents but if you are looking for a great b450 atx motherboard then it is an awesome choice. They make a micro atx and an itx version too. If you want micro atx there is also the mortar max as well."

3185,buildapc,High temps on Custom Loop,"Hey folks,

Built my first custom loop about 5 months back. When I first set everything up ran the standard furmark & prime95 to check temps looked good, everything seemed fine, max load around 75 or so.

Playing a game the other day I checked hwmonitor after and the temps were maxing out at like 93C which is insanely high. I know the fans I’ve got aren’t too smart and don’t scale up that well but I put them on maximum today, ran furmark and prime 95 at the same time and eventually had to kill it when seeing my CPU hitting 100C

What’s odd is that the temp in HWMonitor and Real Temp is totally different to the one in Speedfan, like 15-20C different. HWMonitor and Real Temp are saying my pc is idling at like 40-42C, speedfan is reporting like 29C

I’m not sure which software to believe, and I’m not sure if there’s now something up with my custom loop, if the speedfan temps are to believe I’ve nothing to worry about but the HWMonitor ones are very concerning.

I ran Furmark & Prime 95 to ensure 100% usage on both GPU and CPU, GPU clocks in at 55C max CPU slowly climbs (HWMonitor up to 100C, speedfan stopped at around 75-80)

My spec:
I9-9900K
RTX 2080 TI
64GB Corsair
Asus ROG Formula XI 

Cooling:
Lian Li 011d distro plate
2x 360mm ekrb rads
2x3 thermaltake riing fans 

Loop connects bottom rad - gpu - distro - cpu - top rad - distro 

Am I missing some maintenance here? (There’s no dust on rads) which software do I believe? It seems odd the GPU can max at 55 and the CPU hit 100 if they’re in the same loop"

What should I do and where should I plug my fans into?? Any help is appreciated. This is my first build."
3187,buildapc,Some Concerns Regarding VA Panels...," I play some e-sport games like CSGO and Valorant, but I'm not a massively competitive and serious player, I just play for fun but I do value playing at high ranks and not being disadvantaged...

Will playing on a VA Panel (Samsung CRG50) be a noticeable handicap when it comes to playing games like that? I currently own a 75hz IPS, and it's totally fine when it comes to ghosting/motion blur... Presumably, how much of a downgrade would it be in that field?

Also, I plan on using my current 75hz IPS as a secondary monitor... Will the colour difference be very noticeable when the monitors are set next to each other?

Overall, I know that people can't really give me really precise answers, but I'm sure that many people on here have more of an experience with the two different types of monitors, and thats who I'm aiming to get a response from.

Thanks."

I have all I got except the CPU cooler. I have the RTX 2080 ti and the i9-9900k (Although I should I have gotten the i7-10700k which could been cheaper along with the equivalent motherboard since purchased on May 20th, but they keep selling out often recently, so I'm not sure if it's worth it, I was gonna return my CPU on Thursday once I have it tomorrow). I also have the RMx 850 and the 1TB of SSD NVM. I also have the Corsair ICUE 465x, and an 32GB ram with DDR4-3600. I was also planning to get 2 montiors. I have yet to get the right cooler which is the Corsair H150i cooler (any model) I'm not sure what's any better than that with the 3 fans. If it's been over 30 days that I receive any parts and I still haven't gotten the cooler. I'm not sure if I still eligible to return it even if unopen. Since the pandemic is going hard it's hard to get most of the parts at times. Could they extend the return date or something? Thanks"

During the course of moderating the subreddit, we came to notice a lot of YouTube submissions were spam. Beyond those, however, we looked at the recent [YouTube link submissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/search/?q=url%3Ayoutube.com&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all) and noticed that they consistently score very low on this subreddit, indicating that even amongst the non-spam YouTube submissions, users very rarely find them *oddly satisfying*.
While we do not wish to restrict what can be considered ""oddly satisfying"", as the meaning of this term varies from person to person, in this particular case, given the consistently low scores and the tendency of many of these links to be spam, the mod team is hopeful that this change will benefit this subreddit.

3502,relationships,My parents don't understand that I'm 23F and want a life outside of our extremely small town and possibly our extremely boring state. How do I explain this to them?,"Throwaway because I don't want this associated with my regular reddit account.

I'm an only child, and my parents have always been overprotective. When I was a kid, everyone knew my parents sheltered me. It led me to doing a lot of sexual things when I was in middle school, way too young to even understand that it wasn't okay. Both my parents are agoraphobic (they have a fear of leaving the house), they've done everything from home – online school, remote work, have their groceries delivered. They don't believe in therapy and refuse to get help. They try to get me to switch to online college and try to influence me to get a remote job. Before the pandemic, they were literally living the quarantine lifestyle. I wasn't. Anyway, I didn't realize how much I was being sheltered until I was about 16 and they had a giant issue with me driving. They let me buy a vintage car with my own money, but later admitted that they only let me do that because they knew it would never work, therefore I could never use it. This was the first huge issue I remember having with my parents, because everyone else was driving and I couldn't up until I was 20 years old. Plus, they lied to me and got me excited to drive this awesome car when they knew I never would be able to. This was kind of an embarrassment to me, because at every family gathering, everyone knew my other relatives around my age were allowed to drive and have a life while I wasn't. No one really understood why I still wasn't allowed to drive at 20 years old. On top of this, they tracked my phone whenever I did anything (even going out to eat with my grandparents). I went to college about a half hour from my house and lived there solely because they didn't want me driving. In college, I did a lot of things I regret – I smoked, drank, got in random guys' cars, got in an abusive relationship, and had sex with people I barely knew. It was so fun to be independent. Over time, I finally bought a better car, was allowed to drive, and gained more trust from them somehow. I moved back home for grad school and that's where I'm at now.

About a year ago, my boyfriend and I went on a trip that was about a four hour drive. As a result, my parents didn't talk to me for three days. When I graduated college and was considering moving to a different state for work, they asked me ""what they did wrong to make me want to move so far away."" The other day, I mentioned a cute venue that I saw online where I would love to have my future wedding, which is a three hour drive – they asked why I hate them so much that I would have my wedding ""somewhere other than our backyard."" They refuse to understand why I want a life outside of our rural, boring town. Every time I even mention moving to our state's most happening city, they get mad and say ""ew... why would you want to live there?"" They want me to get a job at the school down the street from our house (I'm studying to become a teacher) and my dad keeps saying the quarantine is a ""dream come true"" for him, because he never wants to leave the house again. They won't let me go to my boyfriend's house and are threatening to not let me back in the house if I go there. They almost wouldn't let me take a job that would've changed the whole trajectory of my career because they didn't want me going out even though it was once a week and I wouldn't be near anyone except one or two people at all times. I understand very well that the pandemic is a serious issue, but the fact that my parents ""won't allow me"" to see my boyfriend or go for a bike ride is really bothering me – like I'm 5 years old when I'm 23F.

What's bothering me even more is that when this is over, I'm going to have to have the talk with them about moving out and possibly moving to a new state. This is something I want very much – I'm getting tired of being unhappy, not living my life to the fullest, and seeing all the other people I grew up with moving far away and living out their dreams. My boyfriend and I are musicians, and the thought of me not ever even TRYING to pursue a career in music is extremely bothersome. I at least want to try. But I'm afraid of the huge backlash I'll get if I move away. ""Why do you hate us so much??"" ""Why wouldn't you want to live here??"" ""Why would you want to move out??"" ""The grass isn't always greener on the other side!!"" ""You'll get killed!!""

I feel horrible even writing this – I love them, I just don't know how to explain to them that I want to have experiences without them reminding me that ""experiences are overrated.""

TL;DR: My parents are extremely overbearing, overprotective, and agoraphobic. How do I tell them that I want to move away and have life experiences without them telling me I don't love them or don't care about my family?

Edit: Thank you SO MUCH for all of your comments, I never imagined I'd have this many! I read all of them – so thank you to everyone even if I don't respond to all!"
3503,relationships,My [29F] SIL [27F] is pretending online that my infant son [9months] is hers,"First of all, I apologize if this post is all over the place. I am very distressed by this situation. So, I found this out from FaceBooks recommendations. SIL always says she has no social media presence, that it stresses her out which is understandable so when I saw the profile, initially, I thought it was a fake. Someone got ahold of her pictures and made it for whatever reason, but as I scrolled the profile almost all of the pictures were either of my son, or of her with my son and the posts detailing ""mom life"". I was very unsettled. 

For some history, SIL has some mental health problems. Bipolar disorder. She holds down a job though and handles her business so I always assumed it was well controlled with medication. It never bothered me and I was never wary of her being around my son. I let her babysit all of the time. Also noteworthy, she cannot have her own children due to some blood thing but she always said she never even wanted kids. She did have a miscarriage several years ago and was told she would never carry to term. She took it well if you believe what she says. 

I only slept 4 hours last night I'm so freaking out about this. My husband, her brother, doesn't think it's a big deal and says she's harmless. He always defends her. She can do no wrong in his eyes. I'm starting to rethink many of her behaviors and things she says, like she has a very dark sense of humor and says things If we're out shopping and she sees a cute baby she'll go ""I want to steal it"". My anxiety is so bad I don't know if am overreacting or not. 

Tldr: SIL is pretending my baby is hers on Facebook. Husband unconcerned. She has a history of mental illness and miscarriage. Is this just something some women do to cope? Am I overreacting? How do I handle this situation?"
3504,relationships,I (20f) have a really weird problem where I can’t call my boyfriend (21m) by his name,"So, I have this really really weird and silly issue where I find it awkward to call my boyfriend by his real name. He has a perfectly common name (it’s not associated with any trauma from my past either) but whenever I text or talk to him, I use the nicknames that we have for each other, like babe etc. In the 2.5 years that we’ve been together, this has always been the case, so somehow it has progressed to the extent where I can ONLY use those nicknames. Just saying his real name out loud feels extremely awkward. I really don’t know why!! For the record, he doesn’t find it disrespectful at all and we were just laughing about it because it’s actually pretty funny, but I would love to be able to say his name again without feeling like I’m calling a stranger. How should I go about fixing this? 

Tldr; I have only called my bf by nicknames and that became the norm and now I find it difficult to use his real name, what should I do?"
3505,relationships,My (25 F) and my partner (28M) cannot agree on finances,"\[This is a throwaway account\]

Me (25 F) and my partner (28M) have been living together for four years, together for seven.

I am in grad school in a tech-related field that will likely get me a good job, and currently do an internship that pays me very little. I am almost graduated. He works in a tech-related field, earning a very good salary (more than 3x my income). Our relationship, aside from this issue, is great: we see eye-to-eye on everything, are happy together, have great discussions and love each other.

However, we can’t seem to agree on finances, to the point that it’s really hurting our relationship. Because he insists on me paying almost the same amount as him to common expenses such as rent and groceries (even though my contribution is still less than his), I nearly spend 90% of my income on common expenses and really need to save in order to buy things for myself, such as a book I like. In contrast, he pays less than half of his income on common expenses and can thus spend every month on expensive gadgets and fun things. It’s really starting to grate on me, because if he even paid a little bit more to the common expenses I would also be able to do and buy more stuff for myself.

However, every conversation we have about it results in a fight. He considers himself a libertarian and thinks it’s already very generous he pays more than me. When I tried to convince him with logical arguments to pay a percentual part of our income (“we are a community, and society also has percentual taxes”) he gets angry, defensive, and upset, telling me he feels like I’m trying to take his money from him and “his lifestyle”, or that taxes are not comparable to our situation and that “our situation is working well”, or that I would still be reliant on his income even if we went to the percentual system. 

Important fact: he got this job after we had been together for several years (so it’s not like I am a golddigger), before that he had been living off his parents, including his mother who lives off a small pension, and got a job after I had been telling him this was not very adult of him.

I also get upset, because I really cannot comprehend how he can happily talk about money he spends on nice things while I don’t have money for anything. I told him, upset, that it seems harsh and cold and that if the situation were reversed, I would happily pay more of my income to let him have more to spend on himself. His response was “I don’t deal in hypotheticals”. He also claims he is doing more housework (which is true, my grad school sometimes has me make 12 hour days after which I am too tired to do anything), which he claims cancels out that I have less to spend for myself. After another fight today, he finally agreed to put only a small amount more - but he made me feel like I had to beg for it. I also told him it feels weird to me he keeps emphasizing I should be grateful.

The weird thing is: he does have future goals like “buying a house together”, but I don’t see how we can do that if he insists on each paying half, or if he doesn’t want to talk about a common financial plan.

I think personally it also has to do with him being an only child that was spoilt by his parents: he is not used to sharing anything, and commonly shared loads really feel like a burden to him. I also feel like his family did not really teach him financial responsibility, nor prioritized it. Example: before this month, even though he had 3x my income, he didn’t save and just spent it all. This is the first month in his 3 years of working he has saved.

Is there anything I can do or say to talk about this and maybe convince him? Is this a reason to decide not to focus on a longer term relationship, even though anything else is going very well and I see myself spending the rest of my life with him?

TL;DR: partner of seven years refuses to talk about finances even though I am unhappy with the financial weight each of us pulls in this relationship: he earns 3x as much as me but refuses to pay significantly more in common expenses. Talking about it results in fights and defensiveness: how to deal with it, possibly convince him? Also: maybe this is a good reason to think about not being together in the longer term?"
3506,relationships,First date advice? I am a 16M who comes from a conservative family and I need a lot of help.,"Hey, thanks for taking the time to read my post. So I am going after quarantine on my first ever date. I cannot stress to you all enough about how oblivious I am to flirting. 

I have a really outgoing personality but with that my flirting skills are like as follows:

>Girl (16F): Bullshit, you are so good looking  
>  
>Me: Thanks

So what I was wondering was what do I do on the first date? 

\- Do I hold her hand?

\- What happens if I have to kiss her, which lip, what do I do?

\- Do I throw my arm around her or is that too forward?

\- Do I hug her or is that creepy

\- What should I say and not say?

\- What do we even do? Like ideas for a first date?

\- How do I act, I am a very 'warm' person but I don't want to come across as overbearing

\- Like what conversation topics?

\- What compliments should I give

\- What is flirting that could come from her side? 

\- What do I reply with

\- How do I calm myself down?

\- What should I do and not do?

**Tl;Dr: I am oblivious to flirting and I need tips and stuff to really tell me what I should and shouldn't do**

I feel like I am asking too many questions, but once again thank you for taking your time to read my post. Any other advice would be 10000000000000% useful and taken into consideration.

Once again thank you."
3507,relationships,My partner (35m) of five years has never dated anyone older than 21 or been in a long term relationship outside of myself. Are those red flags,"Hi so I am a 23f who has been dating my partner, a 35m for five years now and I haven’t been exactly happy in our relationship for the past few months. Of course I did the dumb girlfriend thing and began to overthink things and that’s where it kind of went downhill. I began to piece things together and realized that in all his relationships, his SOs were never older than 21. He has dated about five-six women since high school and two were while he was in high school so yes they were under 21 but after high school he was the guy going after the high school freshmen and having mental breakdowns over them. One of the girls was a young, work acquaintance, another a young childhood friend, and the last was a childhood friend’s little sister. The others were I believe just high school girls going to college parties. This went on until he was about 27-28 and he took a break from women but still flirted with younger girls. None of the five (the sixth girl I cannot quite remember may have been 22-23) relationships lasted more than a year. When he was 30, he met me and we began dating. He has slightly shit talked his former exes but also like...they were under 21. People under 21 in general are immature. I don’t know if he has ever stopped to realize that. 

Looking at it now...it kind of seems like a red flag? The “never been in a long term relationship” I could maybe sideswipe because there are plenty of people who are older than 25 and have never been in a long term relationship, but the ages of his SOs? I may be overthinking it because I’m unhappy with him right now but it comes across in hindsight as a bit predatory. Am I being paranoid?

Edit:
Also when we began dating I had to tell him to stop communicating with one of his online friends that he had been talking to for about 4 years. She was 19. The age at which he began talking to her made me uncomfortable and I told him that. He threw a fit and said I was being overly possessive and didn’t see what was wrong with him having female friends. He finally agreed and texted her goodbye, saying I had told him it wasn’t okay to talk to her and she just never responded and blocked him lol.

My 35m partner has never dated someone under 21 or been in a long term relationship outside of myself and I’m feeling like those two things are beginning to look like red flags"
3508,relationships,Am I F(29) overreacting about my boyfriends M(31) “friend”?,"Am I overreacting about my boyfriends “friend”?

My boyfriend has this “friend” who is a female. Lets call her Sarah. Sarah and him dated a few month prior to when I met him but never worked out due to something out of both of their control. I won’t go into detail but basically they would have continued dating if this “thing” didn’t happen. 
He was up front about her in the start of our relationship but I was always kinda iffy about their friendship. I’ve vocalized to him my feelings towards her and he said “she’ll always be his friend and he doesn’t like to burn bridges.”

Fast forward to last week, my boyfriend and I got into an argument about how he doesn’t comfort me enough when I need him to or doesn’t offer assistance when I’m clearly in need. For example: if I were to cut my hand while cooking, he would run away instead of asking if I need help or a towel or a bandage. 
Well yesterday, I got sun poisoning. I was puking and severely dehydrated. He never asked if I needed anything or what he could do to help. Instead, he just sat on the couch watching tv and playing on his phone. 
I was finally feeling better so I joined him on the couch. Well, he got up to go shower and left his phone. I wanted to continue watching the show so I grab his phone to press play (it was being streamed from his phone) and a message pops up from Sarah. Apparently they were joking around or something because she said lol and some other words indicating it.

I was so pissed and still am. I’m in the bedroom feeling like I’m on my deathbed and he’s choosing to sit in the living room and talk to her. I haven’t spoken to him since I confronted him about the message last night and don’t plan to. He’s upset at me now because I’m giving him the silent treatment but I’m so upset that I don’t know what to even say. 

Tl:dr Am I overreacting about my boyfriends “friend”?"
3509,relationships,"My Grandfather died recently, and it's really taking a toll on my [17M] younger brother [6M].","So my 6 year-old brother has severe Autism, and has always been really close to my grandfather. My brother would always seem to cling to my grandfather whenever he was around and they got along extremely well. Recently, my grandfather passed away due to complications with covid which has really taken a toll onto all of us. Though this has taken an even bigger toll on my brother. I don't quite think he comprehends quite exactly what has happened, but you can definitely tell that he's been a lot more down recently. 

The only thing that has really cheered him up is animal crossing. The other day though, the Nintendo Switch broke. I'm not exactly sure what happened, but when you turned it on, it got EXTREMELY hot, and then simply would run extremely slowly; it was basically unusable. I tried fixing it, but it didn't seem like it was an easy fix and I have no idea what exactly is wrong. So now it saddens me that the only thing that kept him contempt doesn’t even work anymore. I tried getting him on games such as Minecraft and Stardew Valley, but he struggles with the controls as he was so used to the Nintendo Switch. So have no idea what to do anymore.

And financially, we simply aren’t in a position to get a new Switch as my Dad recently got laid off due to the pandemic, and they are a lot more expensive now due to the increase in demand. I was thinking of selling my PC at one point to help him, however, I need it for Uni. So I have no idea what to do. Where do I progress from here to help my brother cope?

Sorry if this was a bit rambly and long.

TL;DR: Grandfather died, younger brother with Autism has struggled to cope. Nintendo Switch broke making it even harder for him to cope. We can't afford a new one. I don't know what to do next."
3510,relationships,Is it weird that my boyfriend (18) bosses me around/takes charge and I (21M) like it?,"Apologies for any mistakes. I've had a reddit account for a few years but I've never used it till now so I'm still learning the ropes. 

My BFs (we've been dating for around 2 years at this point) parents told him that when he turned 18 he wouldn't be allowed to live at home because of his ""unholy lifestyle choices"" so I told him he could move in with me. A week after he turned 18 I helped him pack his things and he moved in with me.

Due to the current global pandemic, we've been home alone and we've grown a lot closer and he's taken the assertive dominant role in our relationship. 

Words can't describe how much I love him and how much I want him to have everything so naturally whenever he tells me to do something, that's my top priority. I just get a thrill out of doing what he tells me to. 

He also has a habit of teasing me about my height and it strangely turns me on. I'm 5'3 and quite skinny but he's 6'5 and pretty muscular so he literally towers over me and he's obviously physically more powerful town me. Quite often he'll put things out of my reach and tbh I enjoy climbing around to get them. He'll even lift me up to get the things that he put out of my reach. It's hard not to get a b*ner when he uses his strong hands to lift me. Sometimes when he's playful he'll even hold me up in the air with one hand.

Sometimes in bed, he'll make me the little spoon and he'll jokingly remind me that he's in charge and there's nothing I can do about it and he can make me do whatever he wants. And no, he's never ""forced"" me to do anything I'm uncomfortable about. 

TL;DR Is it weird or unusual that my boyfriend being assertive and dominant really turns me on and I'm genuinely happy being ""obedient"" and submissive?"
3511,relationships,My(24F) Bf(25M) 1.5yrs accuses me every day of being unfaithful.,"Tite pretty much says it. Almost every single day my BF accuses me of cheating on him. Leaving bed to sit on the couch,  feeding my parents cats when theyre on vacation, going to the store. Doesnt matter what im doing, its all suspicious to him.

This morning, we had a talk about how my new birth control is supposed to stop my cycle and how I havent had one in a while, and as luck has it, I got it a few hours later and he blew up on me. I had stopped an old prescription about 2 months back and started a new one 4 weeks ago and hadnt had my cycle in that time, so I also took a pregnancy  test to be sure. He said all of it wasnt a coincidence and any other person would walk out the door right there. 

Anytime im on my phone, browsing the web, watching videos, reading emails or messages, he always asks who im talking to, if im talking to my other BF, or quickly comes over to look and see what im doing.

I work long hours. Sometimes 12-14hrs with a partner, usually male,(private security patrol) and that has always been an issue for him. Being called to go into our office is an issue, working extra hours is an issue. 

Im a very private person and dont like going out places or having anyone over. I work 8-14hrs a day, 5-6 days a week, and the rest is spent at home. I dont have any friends and not much family. I have 1 kid with my ex-fiance, who lives with my ex-mil because she adopted him, and its always been an issue talking to/being friendly with my ex to gwt pictures, videos, updates, and times I can see my son. 

I just need to know if im doing something wrong here? I dont feel like im doing anything to be accused of this so much.

Tl;dr BF accuses me everyday of cheating,  only thing I do is work and stay home. What am I doing wrong?"
3512,relationships,Butt Touches,"I (22F) feel uncomfortable when my boyfriend (23M) grabs my ass. For a little while it was just in private which was totally fine. Like around the house, sometimes around friends. I've never been super comfortable with it but I put up with it for a while. 

Lately it's been getting more unbearable. He'll (nfsw) get up in there and massage it and it makes my insides squirm with discomfort and embarrassment.  I hate it! He'll smack it around friends all the time now. Always make sexual comments too. 

We had a huge fight about it (one of many usually smaller ones). He told me that he does it because it means I belong to him (and I can do it to him) and it's his way of showing affection. That I should stop being so conservative. He keeps trying to find a ""reason"" for why I hate it, but I don't think I need a reason.

Everytime I try to explain, ""it makes me feel uncomfortable or embarrassed"" ""I feel objectified"" ""It happens too much"" ""it's innappropriate"" he just doesn't get it and responds with ""you don't like when  I show you affection? Maybe you're too conservative. ""

Am I being unreasonable? Every time I try to give him the reason he wants he just fights it. Finding a reason and trying to tell me to be more understanding won't magically make me feel okay about it. Why doesn't he have to compromise? Why do I have to compromise about something that has to do with my own body? Everytime I bring up that it's my body, he argues that we share our bodies with each other when we're in a relationship. This really wasn't what I had in mind when I think of sharing myself with my partner. 

Any advice? Am I in the wrong?

TLDR: I am uncomfortable with him touching my butt as much as he does. He says it shows that he really likes me and refuses to stop."
3513,relationships,My girlfriend (31) and I (27) are having a pause while I consider something she has made her mind up about,"On Sunday we met up for the first time in 2 and a bit months for a social isolation picnic.

Before Covid, we were discussing moving in together after having been in a 2 year relationship as of March.

At the picnic I asked her what we were going to do about this, and she confessed that during all this isolation she has decided that she enjoys her own company so much that she doesn't want to move in with anyone, or have anyone else move in with her.

She has now also changed her mind on wanting kids.

Realistically, I can live with the no kids thing, but the not living together (which she insists would be forever), comes off as very odd. Nevertheless, I also like my own company, but probably not to the extremity of only seeing her every 1 to 2 weekends (as we did before Covid). 

So basically her proposal is this:

* we continue as we are, but this will be forever
* we never get married 
* we never have kids
* we never live together 
* we remain boyfriend and girlfriend for the remainder of our lives and stay exclusive 


I've been noting down some Pros and Cons. 

**Pros:**

* My girlfriend is great. Smart, beautiful and fun
* I love her family 
* I love her home country
* Finances will be secure since we won't marry
* Get my own privacy
* No nagging
* Will eventually be bilingual
* No kids will mean more flexibility in life
* No kids will mean more money and therefore likely to lead to earlier retirement 
* Half the time I speak for the sake of it, because I like her to know that I'm thinking about her. Now I know she wants to be left in her own company for the majority of her time, I don't have to make small talk and ask her how her day is going and whether she slept well. 

**Cons:**

* Only see her 2-4 times a month
* No family of our own
* Sex drive will be crazy since there will be a lack of it
* Will require travel to see my partner
* Will have to be independent


I don't really know what I want to do in this situation. I love her very much, and she means a lot to me. Can someone please provide me with their thoughts on this scenario?

**Tl;Dr:** Girlfriend has come up with a very strange future plan and I am confused. What are your thoughts?"
3514,relationships,Bro [23m] treats our sister [7f] way better than he ever treated me [16f] growing up. It hurts a bit to see.,"Growing up, my bro was more if a bully to me than a big brother. He would frequently bully me to tears, wouldn't do anything together with me, would shut off game consoles while I was playing so he would play, etc.

He's the complete opposite with our sister. When he comes back from work we generally give each other a ""sup"" or ""hello"" and that's it, but whe he sees her it's like ""OMG hellooooo, you are so beautiful, what have you done today, who did you talk to, what did you watch on TV, let's go to your room and do whatever you want the rest of the night"".

And then they'll play in her room and he basically worships everything she does.

So I'm a bit like ""seriously? You were an asshole all my childhood, I was basically scared of you the whole time and now you just flip a switch and treat her like a princess?"".

I want to clarify that I don't want him to treat her how like he treated me. I'd utterly karate chop him if I saw him bully her, but it still hurts that he had all this kindness and never showed it with me.

What should I do about all these feelings?

**tl;dr:** Bro treats our sister waaaay better than he ever treated me. Feels bad, man. What should I do about it?"
3515,relationships,Boyfriend (31M) is uncomfortable having sex with me," 

This has been an off and on situation since November. We have been dating since October.

Basically he wasn't sure why his sex drive was so low (sex 1x every two weeks and maybe 1x a week). He guessed it was some combination of weight gain (we both gained 13-15 ish pounds but we are only slightly over weight), depression, being in a rut, etc. But nothing really changed.

Recently he said that it is totally psychological because he become's physically aroused but he just can't get his head into it. He told me that sometimes he will get horny enough to ""overcome"" his discomfort, like when we had sex last week but normally being uncomfortable wins out. This includes making out, oral sex, and penetrative sex. But he has no issue cuddling naked, taking showers together, giving me hugs or kissing my head/cheek throughout the day or saying sweet things like ""you are pretty"" or ""I love you."" So he isn't sure why he feels ""uncomfortable"" and says it has nothing to do with me. I guess this was also an issue in his last relationship but he always blamed his low sex drive on the fact that they were fighting a lot. We used to fight often but we've gotten a lot better at communication. We are both very affectionate and loving people.

I know he says its not about me, but it still feels like it is. My self esteem is suffering and I am getting more agitated. I usually get agitated when I am sexually frustrated. I have tried having him kiss and hold onto me while I finish myself but it didn't go well and hes offered t go down on me but I just can't get into it because I can tell he's not into it. Guilt takes over and I just can't finish.

After hearing him say he's uncomfortable, I find myself second guessing all physical contact with him and checking in all the time to see if he feels ok. Like I was just kissing him and paused to see if it felt ok. He said it did, but even though he was getting physically aroused he didn't want to progress it any further than kissing and returned to his video games.

I Just don't know what to do. I don't know how to feel ok or how to stop checking in all the time. I don't know how to help him get passed this. He says hes just as frustrated as me because he feels like hes failing and letting me down. He says he wants it to change. So far we agreed this week to do small intimate sexual things like kissing more to see if we can help him be comfortable again. But as I mentioned above, I just struggle with that now too. He currently agitated with me because I started talking about it again and getting upset and he just wants me to appreciate ""what I do have.""

So anyways, advice would be great or if anyone has overcome this I would love to hear about it. I am so scared we will break up over our different libidos and thats just awful because we normally have great chemistry.

tl;dr: Boyfriend is uncomfortable having sex with me and I don't know how to even approach him. Advice appreciated"
3516,relationships,Bf (23M) seems to have lost interest towards me (20F) because of my sport,"Was recommended to post this here for help and advice... First off sorry for my bad English, am not a first native speaker - honestly not sure where to start on this: BF (23M) seems to have almost completely lost interest in me sexually (20F) in recent times. We have never had an amazing sex life but it was alright and that was okay to me, but it's just bad beyond bad now, IMO.

Background: we got together almost 2 years ago, I've always been doing sports, so have been on the more athletic/meaty side since forever (played waterpolo since high school and currently competing for my university). For the record when we first got together till now he's always slammed my sport background and regularly (teasingly) calls me and my teammates/friends names that aren't nice, just as we're more broad-shouldered/buff than the average person? Because he thinks that girls doing physical activities are unattractive and masculine. But other than these semi-jokes he's honestly been an extremely loving and caring boyfriend, which is great so I've somewhat grown to accept/tolerate the former things

Around 2-3 months into our relationship I got into a really bad place emotionally (partially because of his negative outspoken opinions on my sport and my body type but also because of other personal issues too making me enter a state of depression), and ended up kinda neglecting myself and doing bad things like binge-eating alot. Felt horrible and bloated all the time, and coupled with waterpolo and the pool making you very hungry I gained lots of weight, almost 15kg in a year and got very chubby lol. But during this whole time he was always unconditionally loving of me no matter how downtrodden I was/felt, and was always there for me! Which I really appreciated and will never forget

After that dark phase I decided that I really had to get out of my own horrible pit and start taking care of myself again, started taking my meds regularly and going back to practice and also training 6-7 days a week. 9 months through lost a ton of weight and put on a sizeable amount of lean mass relatively, like having kinda ""manly"" defined biceps and visible stomach muscles... because of that throughout this period even though he was sweet in other aspects, he got back to insulting our sport and me again, e.g. calling me ""gross"" for having muscular arms and a ""4-pack"" and I could feel our relationship deteriorating emotionally and sexually. He never initiates anything sexual anymore and is very unresponsive even when I try to, and nowadays during the rare times we get it on he almost makes disgusted faces when he sees my body (which is extremely extremely hurtful to me and my self-esteem), but also does mind-boggling things like touching/holding onto or caressing my shoulders/biceps and abs when we do actually end up making love...? Which is really weird and contrary to everything else

Our bedroom is pretty much dead right now and he doesn't want to talk about it, when I try to bring it up he's uncommunicative and just keeps going back to his opinion that I'm unfeminine now, which he brings up almost day-to-day whenever he's reminded of it. Today was the last straw when he outright said something like *""your revolting arm muscles are bulging and that's sickening""* when I was doing up my hair and changing while he was there waiting for me. He then walked out of the apartment. I'm alone now crying in the toilet as I'm typing this, I really love him a lot and want to salvage this relationship, and I know he loves me a lot too. I'm pretty much at a loss of what to do and really need help from anyone

TLDR: boyfriend finds me repulsive because of my sport, our sex life is dead but he refuses to communicate. **I would really want to try my best to repair and respark the fire in this relationship, would appreciate any and all advice**"
3517,relationships,"I [27F] unknowingly dated a married man [31M] a couple months ago, he is now leaving his wife and wants to stay with me. I don't know if I want him to.","So before this whole covid thing happened I drunkenly hooked up with this guy and then we casually dated. I liked him, we had a fun time and he seemed pretty nice but then he admitted to me he was actually married. He gave the excuse of a bad marriage, no sex etc, he was drunk and hadn’t planned to do it (obvious lie as he planned ahead enough to remove his wedding ring,). Anyway, I didn’t seem him again and we didn’t talk again.


Then covid happened and we got a stay at home order. A couple weeks into it he messaged me to check how I was doing. Yes, I probably should have ignored him but I was bored and pretty lonely (I live alone) so we have been messaging since then. We talked quite a lot and he told me a lot more about his marriage, though I have no idea if he is lying or not but it did for real seem like he was struggling being locked in together.


Yesterday I got a call from him and he told me that he and his wife have agreed to separate and so he can’t stay with his wife anymore and he asked if he could stay with me? He said it would just be a short time until he got a place of his own but I was a “preferred option” because I live alone and have no kids or anything so it would be low risk. He also said he really likes me and thinks maybe we have something.


I just said I would think about it (he wants to come tomorrow). I do feel kind of sorry for him, it is a rough time for relationships but then I remember he cheated on his wife, which is a shit thing to do even if you’re marriage is dead. But then maybe I kinda led him on by messaging him through all this but I did never ask him to leave his wife or anything for me. I did/do like him but I don’t know if I want a relationship with him. It has all happened really quickly. But also, there’s a global pandemic and maybe I should be a nice person and let him stay for a couple days. Honestly, I would feel better about that if hadn’t said “maybe we have something”, because now I feel weird that he’s doing this because he likes me. Advice? Is it rude to say no?  I feel bad about saying no because even if I didn’t want to be, I am now involved in his breakup.

**tl;dr**: I dated a married guy (I didn't know) a couple months ago. Now he is leaving with his wife and asked to stay with me (temporarily) but he also said he likes me. I don't really want to be involved but I am and feel bad about saying no."
3518,relationships,I'm feeling insecure with the girl I'm dating when I didn't feel that way before.,"Basically when I (25M) first met this girl (26F) I was this confident guy who she was really into, not that she isn't into me now but for some reason my confidence has dropped after 2 months of dating. I'm constantly worrying about whether she's still into me or not, if she may be attracted to other guys, if she still finds me attractive, if she feels the same way as before, etc.

The first few weeks she was all cute and romantic and all, now she's still kind of cute with me but she has transitioned as more of a ""friendly"" kinda thing with romantic stuff too, she's playful, sometimes gets a little aggressive (in a fun respectful way of course), we kind of roast each other just for fun (again, respectfully). I don't know if that's because we've grown more together and she feels like she can trust me more, my guess is that she feels comfortable with me. I'm aware that your partner should be your best friend and you should treat yourselves as such, and usually this isn't an issue, and probably in this case it isn't either, but then I wouldn't know why I'm feeling so anxious about this going south if everything is working just fine. I don't know if it's going ""too good"" for it to be actually true...

She says she's really feeling something different when we're together, she says that as soon as I leave she starts to miss me and she gets emotional with the songs I tell her to listen to because they remind her of me, but for some reason I feel way too insecure now. This is the first time I feel this way, I'm usually pretty confident, but I don't know what's happening.

Is this normal? How do you cope with this?

TL;DR: After 2 months of dating a girl as a confident guy I'm starting to feel insecure and it's giving me anxiety, is this normal? How do you cope with this?"
3519,relationships,My boyfriend (28M) is best friends with his parents. I (25F) want him to stop sharing so much info about me to them.,"Me and my BF have been together for 2 years now. Our relationship is great, i really don’t have much to say but good things about us as a couple. 

I know he has a great relationship with his parents. As an only child, they bond so well like the perfect family we all want to be a part of. I also know they call eacb other often and talk about everything. 

I didn’t really think much of it as an issue until recently that he told me that he shared to his parents how much I make. The number doesn’t matter at all, what was hurtful was him pointing out that it was a minimum wage salary. 

He didn’t realize this was a bad thing because he said he feels like we’re family (him, me and his parents).  I don’t feel the family aspect yet tho since we’re not yet married and I haven’t spent significant time with his parents to give a family kind of trust. 

But more than that, i just learned he also shares other problematic stuff about my family to his parents. My family isn’t as perfect as his, and we have issues. I’m not gonna list them down, but i would say there are troublesome ones.  

I’m just not sure how to approach. I don’t wanna break his relationship with his parents. But I also want a best friend out of him who I can talk freely about anything to and not find out that our conversations are getting passed to his parents. 

I’m all eyes and ears! 
Thank you! 

TLDR: BF tells his parent most of the things we talk about. Lately i found out he revealed my salary to them. I’m not comfortable with them knowing that yet. Also found out he shares my family issues with them. I don’t want them to be aware of that either. What’s the best way to approach this without hurting his relationship with his parents?"

I'm so happy for him (and so bored having nothing to plan for since we're stuck inside), and I've really gone all in researching programs and mapping out a potential course schedule. I've asked him a few times if this bothers him, or if I'm overreaching (I think I might be), but he said he's grateful for the help because his parents didn't go to college, so he doesn't have any idea where to start.

We've always had different ideas about formal education. I love it. I was a huge nerd in hs, went to a great college, and I'm working towards my masters now. He's interested in formal education only when it's practical (aka, you need it for your job), and he doesn't make an effort when it's not. For example, he started college right after he graduated hs, but he dropped out halfway through his first year because he was able to get a good paying job. He's never had issues with employment until now, which is why he's decided to try college again.

So here's where I really need some advice. He's just started some summer classes (gen ed stuff, not related to his chosen major), and I'm really involved in his coursework right now. I mapped out his assignments on a calendar, read all the syllabi, dictated some emails to professors, and I keep nagging him about his homework. He asked me this morning if this is how I'll be when we have kids and they start school, and I'm horrified. My parents weren't like this at all with me, but have I accidentally turned into a helicopter parent for my husband (gross)? He said he appreciates the help, but I can't tell if 1.he's being polite or 2.he likes it because I'm doing some the organizing that he should be learning to do. I want to help him succeed, but I don't want to do the work for him. I definitely don't want to be like this when we have kids.

TL;DR My husband just started college classes, and asked me if I'm going to be as involved with our future children's education as I am with his. I've mapped out a course schedule for him, and I'm following along with all his classes. I want him to succeed. Help me. Should I back the hell off?"
3521,relationships,How do I gently tell my bf to lower his expectations?,"I (27 F) started seeing my bf (28 M) about six months ago. I needed to take things slowly, and he was very understanding of that. We decided to ""officially"" become a couple about a week ago. Really, all that changed was that we would start introducing each other as bf/gf to other people instead of referring to each other as ""the guy/girl I've been seeing.""

Since we became ""official,"" he's been... a bit different. I'm not a particularly affectionate person. I've been likened to a house cat in that I want affection when I want it, but when I don't, I *really* don't. He's an extremely affectionate person, but has tried very hard to give me space. In return, I try to be more physically affectionate than what generally comes naturally to me.

Since our conversation regarding our relationship status, though, he's been *much* more affectionate and less cognisant of me needing space. He's pushed the ""L-word"" on me a few times, saying that I don't have to tell him that I love him, he can see it in my actions. But I don't love him. I'm not at that point yet. I care about him a lot, and obviously want to keep him around, but I feel like, since we became an official couple, he's moving at warp speed. I still need to go slowly. When he said that, I told him that I need him to understand that, even though we've moved forward in our relationship, that doesn't mean that I automatically love him. (I said it nicer than that in the conversation, but I can't remember the exact wording.)

He's always been quite needy, but in the past week, he's been calling me all the time (even when he knows I'm having a rare, socially-distant visit with my family), he's assumed that I'm going to be staying with him all the time even though I have an apartment that I pay to live in, and has been dropping the L-Bomb. How do I tell him as gently as possible that I still need to take things slowly and that I'm starting to feel smothered?

TL;DR — A week after becoming an ""official"" couple, my bf is being very needy and is starting to drop L-Bombs. How do I very gently tell him that I'm not in the same place and that he should lower his expectations?"
3522,relationships,My SO is no longer abusive; I feel like I'm scarred,"Tl;dr: I can't relax even though my formerly toxic relationship is now healthy

I (28M) have been with my partner (27F) for 3 years. My partner was verbally, emotionally and physically abusive for the first two years and eventually decided she wanted to change and not lose me. She has changed, she's pretty much a different person and is treating me much better and catching herself when the toxic behaviors try to surface.

Here's the problem: I am constantly having memories of the bad times. It feels like I'm constantly on high alert for the switch to flip and everything to go bad again. I only experience flashbacks in very specific scenarios; the rest of the time, I just can't relax.

Does this stop? Will time heal?"
3523,relationships,How long to wait for I love you?,"I (female 24) told my boyfriend (male 25) that I loved him about three months ago now and he hasn't said it back. When I told him he said it was too early and he didn't want to say it until he knew for sure. I respected that and told him I wouldn't be waiting for it.  
So we have been officially dating six months but sleeping together for ten. I fall in love hard and fast and I'm very expressive in nature. I tell myself he probably will say it and I /know/ that rushing him or pressuring him is not the answer but I am starting to understand that at some point I will probably have a cut off time.  
I don't feel like anyone should put a timer on anything when it comes to relationships but I want the real deal and the longer I wait and get my hopes up the harder I fall.  
Right now I feel really upset, I'm just worked up over it. I really love him and I just want it to work out, I think it will but I'm starting to doubt it.  
One of my friends waited a whole year for her boyfriend to say I love you. She is very mature and patient and they have a wonderfull relationship.  
I guess I'm just scared, I'm not sure I can wait that long? I don't know.  
Why can't everything be perfect right? haha

3524,relationships,My (23F) boyfriend (23M) never wants to leave the bedroom,"I’m realizing that the title comes off as sexual, but that’s not what I’m talking about haha.

We live in a fairly hot climate (May-October has consistent days above 85 fahrenheit and even hotter in summer months) with my boyfriend’s dad. They won’t run the central air unless it reaches 85 in the living room (the coolest room in the house) despite the fact that I’ve offered to help with the energy bill. 

My boyfriend is very anxious around his father and doesn’t like to spend time in the condo’s living spaces or to leave the bedroom door open (even though he owns a third of it and his dad has emphasized that we are welcome to hang out in common areas). 

The bedroom gets to 10 degrees Fahrenheit more than the temperature outside because of the sun beating down on our side of the building and the lack of air flow. 

It gets so hot that we’re drenched in sweat from 11am-6pm. Any time I ask to open the door or to go hang out downstairs, he gets anxious and sometimes even angry with me. 

How do I (1) convince him that these aren’t appropriate living conditions and (2) help him with his anxiety about hanging around his dad. We’re not moving out any time soon due to financial reasons. (That’s probably a little over a year down the road when we both finish with school).

tl;dr: My bf’s too anxious to spend time in the common areas of the house, but the bedroom gets between 85-100 degrees every day from 11-6."
3525,relationships,Boyfriend (29/m) got fired because he was trying to be like my (31/f) ex!,"My boyfriend just lost his job because he was trying so hard to be like my ex!

It is very upsetting to me! 

A few months ago, my boyfriend learned that my ex was able to provide a fairly lavish lifestyle for us. It was hard to explain what my ex did for a living.

My ex was basically a con artist. He’d go work for business then eventually pressure people in high position into a horrible deal. Gradually he’d just push them until they basically pay up his contract or pay him to leave.  But my ex come from a family of attorneys and knows tons of people in high position. That’s how he was able to make this work.

My boyfriend doesn’t have any of that! He stupidly assumed he found a way. He tried it and got fired for it!

I’m so angry! One thing I love about my boyfriend is, he was the type of man who always take on extra works, will stay late, is first in and last out, very willing to pull his shirt off and jump into the ditch right away.

I don’t want to be with someone who cheat, steal, and backstabbing others even if it is to my profit!

My boyfriend is extremely worried that I want what my ex was able to provide. He also have been saying things like it must be nice to be paid so much to quit and all that! It is pissing me off!

This isn’t kind of man I want to be with!

Tldr; my boyfriend thinks he’s not good enough for me. Tried to be like my ex and now got ourselves even deeper in the hole!"
3526,relationships,How do I (31 f) stop wanting to find someone who cares about me enough to marry me?,"It’s a very stupid thing- but I’ve always wanted to get married and have that commitment to someone. 
This obviously hasn’t happened since I am here. 

I don’t need the relationship as a crutch. I’m actually pretty good at being alone and using my friends as a support network. 

I think I communicate decently in relationships and have been told I do in the past, but at the end of the day no one wants to actually commit to me in the manner I wild like. So I would love to stop wanting it. 

Any advice on how to? I’m just so insanely tired of the never ending disappointment. 

TLDR: I want to be married, no one wants to marry me. How do I stop wanting to be married?"
3527,relationships,Girlfriend of 2.5 years randomly stopped talking to me,"Girlfriend randomly stopped talking to me

Hey, kinda new here, so a few days ago my girlfriend of 2.5 years, randomly stopped talking to me. I have no idea why, it started Last Friday night but I’ll give a little backstory. So me and her have had a very healthy relationship, very little arguing or fighting, we always got along and it was a match made in heaven. We clicked since high school and she my was my girlfriend throughout my senior year and just recently herself graduated, she’s 18 and I’m 21 btw. so we always talked about staying together and moving in you know the usual love story made to be. But we have had our ups and downs. now maybe 2 years into the relationship we did break up or took a break, however you want to call it, when it happened she did the same thing she did to me now ( I’ll explain in a few ) it was very sudden and long story short she told me that she “ wanted to find herself “. We eventually got back together and made up and you know the usual everything went well. Fast forward to now and it was a normal Friday, we planned to hangout as it was my off day and she goes into work at 5, so I woke up early went to her house and it was a normal great day, we went out ate and had a good time, around 4:30 I have her a hug and kiss goodbye and she went to work and I went home. Now usually when she gets off she’ll text me and we’ll video chat for a little bit till she or me falls Asleep. Well come around to 10 ( the time she gets off ) and she doesn’t text or call or anything. We have the life 360 app ( she made me download it ) and it told me she got home, so I attempted to call her but to no remorse, she didn’t answer my texts or calls anything. I thought okay ? Maybe she fell asleep, it’s happened before, long day at work, Well I assumed everything was well and went to bed. I had work at 8am so I woke up texted her good morning and went to work, she usually wakes up around 11-1ish and tells me good afternoon, well...... nothing the whole day she didn’t text me I tried calling her texting, texting her nothing was working. I didn’t worry a bit until she started opening the messages and leaving me on read without responding, well that Saturday she had work again and went into work at 5 and posted on her Snapchat story and I knew something was up, ( she’s still been ignoring my calls and texts since I woke up at 8 btw ). So come around 9:17 to be exact I check on life 360 and my heart sank a little she turned off her location so I couldn’t see anymore. And then... we’ll I checked instagram and she took me off her instagram bio and took all our pictures down. I was so confused and had no idea what was going on. So I had no idea what she was doing that night but again I texted her around her get off time ( 10pm) and again ignored my calls and texts. Fast forward to Sunday and again same thing, ignoring my calls and texts and now today it’s the same, I just wish she could tell me what’s going on I just don’t understand, after 2.5 years together I figure it wouldn’t be hard to tell me how she felt but I’m left in the dark. 
TL;DR I need a second opinion on what you guys think, because I’m completely confused on what’s going on."
3528,relationships,Boyfriend [22M] uncomfortable with me [23F] living with male friend [28M],"We'd be living in a 3 bed/2 bath house with one other girl. My boyfriend (Henry) says he's uncomfortable with me living with a male friend (Frank) because all the female/male friend roommate duos he has known have ended up sleeping together. Henry asked me how I would feel if a female friend of his moved in with him. Honestly, I'd be fine with it because I trust him! Henry says he trusts me, it's Frank, and all other guys, he doesn't trust. The thing is, Frank is one of the nicest, least-threatening guys I know. Frank is the last person to come in between a relationship; he likes Henry a lot! I get the feeling Henry is upset because he asked me to move in with him, but I said no because we'd only be dating 7 months by then. So in his mind I'm choosing another man over him.

Henry says it's ultimately my choice. But I don't want to be uncomfortable every time Henry comes over, knowing that he is suspicious of Frank. Do I go ahead and move in with Frank and the other girl? Or do I take Henry's feelings into account and not do it?

TL;DR!: Seems short enough to me."
3529,relationships,My Parents are Giving my Girlfriend (F18) and me (M19) an Ultimatum: Us or Them—Need Urgent Help.,"I’ll try to be concise but there's a lot to consider (sorry). Currently we’ve been dating for a year and a half.

Growing up in Austin I was in a very controlling house. My parents heavily monitored what I did on my phone, whether it was who I called or what messages I sent, among a lot more things. It was difficult to hang out with people because I was given harsh time slots—if I didn’t make it back in time my phone would be taken for weeks and I would be unable to go out again for months. 

Fast forward to a year ago, I started dating a girl who was still in high school a while before I left for college. My parents thought that I would not continue it as a long-distance relationship. Yet, we stayed together, talking on the phone every day for long periods of time. Between school, an intense club I was a part of, and my not-super-social nature, I did not leave my room much to socialize so I could focus on homework. When my parents found out about this, they were furious. They blamed her occupation of my time talking for my lack of sleep and social interactions during my first year in college, when I was supposed to explore the social scene the most. My gf and I addressed this issue and have since cut back on how much we talk and no longer sacrifice sleep. My social circle still did not expand at school, and I did notfault her for it, though my parents still did. Additionally, when I was back on break, I spent more time with her than I did with my family, which further infuriated them to the point that they began to control how often I saw her. This made me upset, as I wanted to spend a lot of time with the one I was in love with—being long distance, it was already really hard.

By the time the next break came around, my parents heavily restricted the times I could see my girlfriend. Because of this, I lied to my parents about when I was seeing her. My parents found out about these lies and, again, were furious.

By this time, they also claimed to have figured out the type of person my girlfriend was. She was going through tough times in the fall that made her question a lot of what her path in life looked like and caused a lot of changes to occur within a short amount of time regarding what she wanted to do with her future. Citing her inability to have a consistent future plan, the possibility of her to go through another time like this again, and the lack of sleep and social life they *believed* she was causing me, they told me to break up with her. Knowing that my parents never had a full conversation with my girlfriend (and thus did not truly know her, but thought they did through assumptions of people of her “type”), I didn’t agree with them. She wasn’t affecting my performance at school, I’m generally more reserved (smaller circle of friends), and I still stayed awake in all my classes and got a very high GPA (4.0). Despite this, to please my parents, I listened and broke up with her—but it only for six hours until I called her while I was on my way back to college because I’m in love with her and I really did not want her out of my life.

One of the biggest concerns my parents have is my girlfriend’s mental health. During her confusing time, one of her good friends committed suicide which caused her to spiral. Although she was in a depressive state with scary thoughts, on her own volition she found help in the form of a therapist, found coping strategies, and ultimately pulled herself out of the slump with no harm done. To this my parents told me that if this depressive state happened once, it can easily happen again and could possibly be worse and therefore it is a red flag, as it had happened once before, but got considerably better at handling it the second time. I think that my girlfriend did amazingly well in the tough time, but my parents thoroughly believe it will be a recurring problem.

In the summer when I was back for a long amount of time, I started trying to see her again. But my parents continued to resist, telling me to break up with her, to explore more of what college has to offer instead of being in my room all the time. I am naturally not as social so I didn’t see it as problematic as they did, but I’m confused if it’s actually a problem. My gf and I have tried to accommodate their complaints without having to break up. My parents, however, do not want to listen to what I have to say or try to understand my viewpoint—my mom even stopped talking to me for casual conversation for more than a month. Sometimes, they say they want to talk, but whenever we try to, it's them talking TO me, leaving no space for me to explain my side. When I finally do get to put a word in, they don’t seem like they even try to understand, and I feel like they’re so stuck in their ways: they will only stop when I break up with her. Even if my gf and I try to provide compromises to resolve some issues without having to break up, they do not think they will work. Because of my unwillingness to break up, they have resorted to an ultimatum: either my family or my girlfriend. I am confused on whether the red flags they see my gf has (particularly her mental health) are legitimate or not, as she treats me very well, makes me happy, and I’m in love with her. I’m also confused whether the problems they bring up are actually the problem or if it’s something else because when we have a solution, they still don’t like it. I am a legal adult, am financially independent, and have a safe place to go, so that is not an issue for me. Thoughts? I feel so lost :/ I don’t want to lose either of them.

TL;DR My parents have a problem with my girlfriend, claims she has red flags which are questionable, and is forcing me to choose between them or her."
3530,relationships,Is masturbation ok in a marriage?,"Me (24) and my gf (22) are having a disagreement about whether a person should masturbate if they are in a fulfilling relationship and if the other partner has a right to be unhappy about it.
She says if you're having sex there should be no reason to ever need to and you should just wait if their not in the mood
I say if your horny and your partner isnt in the mood then there should be no reason not to handle your own buisness in a way that hurts nobody.

What do you think? More details on request.

Tl;dr gf thinks that married men shouldn't masturbate and I think shes being unreasonable

EDIT: so I broke it down exactly what the issue was and she says ""do what you want"" I'm sad she seems upset about it but better now that 10 years from now. Normally I'll flex with her but I had to put my foot down today. Hopefully she comes around because I  care about her alot but she has some things she needs to work put for herself that I cant help her with😤😩"
3531,relationships,I’m jealous of my (21F) boyfriends (22M) relationship with his twin sister. And he’s not understanding or helping.,"Pretty much exactly what I said. His sister and I don’t NOT get along, but there has been miscommunication on things and I don’t agree with all of the things she has done and some of the things made me upset while we were hanging out. If I’m in the wrong, he will straight up defend her side. But if she’s in the wrong, he’ll roll it off like it’s not a big deal or come up with “alternatives” to avoid sticking up for me. It’s annoyingly and irritating. I addressed it to him on Friday and he said he’ll work on it but may take time. I just don’t understand why it’s so hard? I get she’s your twin. But you shouldn’t treat us differently when it comes to that. I understand and I’m not trying to replace her. 

The most recent example happened over the last week. This past Friday the two of us and his sister and her boyfriend all got hibatchi takeout. I only asked for two things, and I didn’t think it was a lot to ask for. I asked that we eat outside and that we take separate cars because of Covid-19. My grandfather passed with it so I’ve been really nervous about it and I didn’t think it was a lot to ask for. So my boyfriend said no problem and told her. She IMMEDIATELY texted me and was like “wouldn’t it be better if we take one car because of gas. And don’t worry no one else will be home it will just be us”. I got a little upset because I took that as she was trying to get her way. It also upset me because she only texts me when it’s convenient for her. I text her all the time about stuff and she never replies. I mentioned this to my boyfriend and all he did was say “she just wants to make you comfortable.” Which I can see, but he was totally ignoring my side. We literally went back and forth on this for 3 days. Thursday he tells her that we’re going in 2 cars and she’s like “well i wanted to go in one so we can hangout and listen to music and talk”. And I’m just like “you literally have been defending her for 3 days when i have been saying she just wanted to get her way and she pretty much just admitted to that.” Then Friday comes, and he tells me that we will meet them at the house and she will already have the food there. We get there and she’s like, “I didn’t get the chance to order the food yet”. This immediately annoys me because I felt like she did that on purpose to get her way. So my boyfriend asks if we can wait at the house and she’s like “preferably not”. So obviously she just wanted it all to go her way?? I thought i was nice enough just to even go to the house. So my boyfriend is like to me “I’ll let you decide what to do”. Instead of sticking up for me. 

Maybe I’m overreacting but so many little things added up into one large thing and it’s soooo frustrating. He tells me I’m his #1 but he doesn’t always treat me like it. I have a past where I was always made feel like I was less important than someone else, even to my own father. My dad left my family and to this day he takes care of and pays more attention to his step daughter than he even talks to me. My past with my dad intensifies my feelings of feeling unimportant and replaceable. I understand, twins have an unimaginable bond. I wouldn’t want their bond to change. However, I want how he treats us so differently in defense to change. Am I asking for too much? Every time I ask he says he’ll “work on it”. I just don’t know why it’s so hard to stick up for me but he has no problem doing it for her. We’ve been together for over a year. We have talked about getting married, moving in, and having kids in the future. But I don’t want to if this doesn’t change. They can’t rely on each other forever. I appreciate honest feedback, thanks.

TL;DR: I’m jealous and annoyed with my boyfriend and his twin sisters relationship. He constantly defends his twin sister even if she’s in the wrong and there’s proof she’s in the wrong. It’s so irritating and I just want him to have my back the way he has hers. I understand twins have a special bond, but I need help."
3532,relationships,Any advice for relationship anxiety?,"TLDR: I’ve suffered from relationship anxiety my whole life. Currently dating someone new a few months in, falling for him but really worried it’s going to end soon, or that I’m so anxious about it ending I’ll manifest it. 

Sorry if this is long! :( I’ve (26f) suffered anxiety my whole life and on/off the past 10 years I’ve gone to try and get help. It definitely gets worse when I’m dating someone and I start to lose control of the situation. Not knowing what’s going to happen and how the other person truly feels kills me. 

I’ve recently started seeing someone (32m) and he’s amazing. He’s the first guy I’ve been able to talk to kinda freely and so far we have great communication, and I think he understands that I’m an anxious person. He’s very sweet and has told me how he feels. We’ve had a few moments recently where I’ve gotten upset and we’ve talked it through and he’s helped me. But now I’m just being paranoid and questioning every little thing he does or doesn’t do (in my head), and I’m so worried it’s going to end. I can’t calm down about it or stop thinking about the relationship. It feels too good to be true, and I’m so worried it’s not true. 

I really, really like this guy. I think for the first time in my life it could be something, he’s different to other guys I’ve dated. It’s gotten to the point now though where my other relationships have ended, and I’m scared that this is going to go the same way. That he’s suddenly going to ghost me or change his mind like the others. Or that he’s just lying to me about everything. 

Does anyone have any tips on how to manage this? Whilst being in lockdown I don’t have my normal methods of easing my anxiety, so I’m struggling more than normal. I’m going to try and see my therapist for help but would love to know I’m not alone in this in the meantime."
3533,relationships,TL;DR Partner not attracted to me because of weight gain.,"I’m new to reddit but I’m really looking for advice. I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 2 years (I’m 22F hes 28M) and when we first met I was in the best physical shape of my life. Once i met him I picked up his bad eating habits and gained a lot f weight. Since then he hasn’t wanted to have sex often and after I broke up with him because of it he finally admitted that his low sex drive was because i had gained weight. He said he still loves me and thinks I’m beautiful but that he wants for us to both get back into shape to help his sex drive.

Ive always wanted to get back into shape, however i am embarrassed and insecure about the truth of him not being attracted to me at this weight. I guess I’m looking for advice to see if this makes him a bad person or not(or if his lack of attraction is fair)? I understand that we are allowed to be attracted to certain things. Ive never been in the situation where my partners body changed significantly/or to something I’m not attracted to.

And i know that our relationship isn’t just about how i look (he didnt want to break up in the first place because he still loves me as a person). If it is fair that he isn’t attracted to me at this weight and we can work on it together, how can i still feel sexy/beautiful during the process of losing weight? Like i said, Ive always wanted to lose the weight and would be doing this for myself as well.

TL;DR"
3534,relationships,"My girlfriend (F25) broke up with me (F25) because she didn't feel like a priority. Now I'm in quarantine by myself, unsure how to move ahead.","I am from the US, but we live in Peru and my now-ex is Peruvian. In typical queer-girl fashion, things got super serious super fast. She was (and still is) smart, passionate, open-minded, and thoughtful. I was the first girl she had ever been with (she’s bi), and she told me that being with me helped her to accept things about herself that she never had before. When we first became an official couple, she made it clear that her coming out to her homophobic mother was not a possibility, at least for a long time. I understood and knew that she needed to wait to come out until she was ready.

The toll of being in the closet was really tough on her and she felt insecure about the relationship in general. I went to visit my brother, who I only see about four weeks per year, and my girlfriend and I often fought about me going a little AWOL via text, as I would sometimes not respond at all during a dinner with my brother and it made her feel terrible.  Nine months into our relationship, her mom sneakily logged into her Whatsapp and read the messages between us and learned that we were a couple, not friends as we had explained to her. Her mom told her to choose between living under her roof or me. She chose me and moved out.

When she moved out, she was super excited for me to come over to her new place a lot. Even though she basically “fell out” of the closet (came out involuntarily) she had a new sense of freedom and some weight lifted off her shoulders, as her mother had not literally “killed her” as she had feared. I don’t have a car, so I would take a 20-minute taxi ride to see her. She has a motorcycle, so she went to my place a lot more frequently than I went to hers, which made her feel unloved.

This past year, I have been a first-year teacher so I’m super stressed and overwhelmed with all the work that I need to do, in addition to managing a difficult classroom of fourth graders. This took a huge toll on our relationship as I would be super tired when I got home, I would be super tired and not totally present. I also didn’t cook for her or do romantic things as much as I used to at the beginning of our relationship. Sometimes, my coworkers would invite me for a beer after work and I would happily go, but then my girlfriend would be upset that I didn’t let her know I was going, even though the get-togethers were totally spontaneous.

When I visited my family over Christmas break, my uncle (I was very close to him), suddenly had a stroke and we spent almost two weeks in the hospital before he died. Days after, I flew back to keep working without fully processing what had happened. Two and a half months later, quarantine started. My girlfriend came to stay with me and we had a wonderful ten days together. But I started to feel super homesick and decided that I needed to go home via a small plane carrying out diplomatic flights, fully intending to come back to Peru after two months or so. I bought some tickets and even though she was clearly sad about it, she helped me with some logistics in going home. Again, she was very disappointed because she had planned to spend at least two months with me in quarantine. She went back to her place. Then, I decided not to go home, (1) because I was terrified to fly at a time like this and maybe make my family sick and perhaps have more deaths in the family, and (2) because I was excited to spend more time with her.

I called her and told her I was going to stay in Peru, and she wasn’t as excited as I had hoped. She had been so excited to spend this time, and I had chosen to go home not knowing when I would be allowed to re-enter Peru due to travel restrictions (even though I ultimately didn’t go back to the US). She said that she had planned to break up with me when I got home to the US. We didn’t speak for two weeks before she called me asking what I would do to make her more of a priority in her life. I honestly didn’t know how to respond because I didn’t even know if we were still in a relationship. Then she found out through a friend that I had turned down another opportunity to go home. She was curious about this so she called me and asked why I didn’t go home this second time. I told her I wanted to be with her and see her, so I went over to her house and spent four days with her. It was amazing and felt like old times, and then I returned to my apartment, excited about our relationship again.

A few days after though, she sent me a message saying she felt weird about the four days we had just spent together. We met up two days ago and she told me she needed to talk to me. She said that despite the fun we had last week, we cannot be together anymore because it is clear we see relationships differently and she doesn’t see herself moving in with me or having our relationship progress any further. She was very hurt that I wanted to go home to my family even though she had chosen me over living with her family. So we are over. And I’m by myself in quarantine with no way to do the typical “post-breakup” activities that could help me move on. Now, I'm wondering how to move ahead. How does one balance family, friends, AND a relationship? I think that I probably suck at it. Oh, and there’s a balloon she gave me on Valentine’s Day in my house that says “I love being by your side” that I need to get rid of.

P.S. I’m sorry for the extremely long post. Nobody is obligated to read it all. But it did give me some clarity writing everything out. As for what is clearer, I’m not 100% sure. Though I do feel a bit better. Any and all thoughts are totally welcome.

TL;DR Various life events made me not able to be the best girlfriend I can be (but I do think that I could have handled some things better, regardless of my situation). My girlfriend of almost two years broke up with me because she felt that we were not on the same page and want different things out of a relationship. Now I’m newly single and quarantined by myself. Feels bad, man."
3535,relationships,My [23F] boyfriend [23M] won’t stop playing video games,"
My bf and I have been together for 2 years and we recently officially moved in together due to covid. This feels like a very cliche issue to be having but it’s really creating a rift.

He’s always been into video games which I’m fine with. It’s a hobby and it’s something he gets to do with friends of his that live far away. I usually don’t have a problem with the gaming until we moved in together. Since quarantine he’s started to do nothing but play all day. He recently graduated and was meant to have been applying to jobs but he doesn’t seem to take it that seriously and instead spends like an hour applying to jobs one day a week and 9+ everyday playing video games. 

I’m all for people having their interests but we spend almost no quality time together. He is constantly tethered to the computer and “can’t” leave because he’s playing with other people. So many things have fallen to the wayside because his only focus is playing games. The computer he plays on is also in our bedroom so I can’t even go to sleep when I want because the lights from the screen are in my face and he’s talking on his headset. And no, there’s no where else to put it in the apartment.

I’ve brought this issue up with him and he acknowledges there’s a problem but does nothing about it. It’s honestly like he’s addicted to it. He has had some problems with depression and motivation which I assume has something to do with it but he doesn’t like to talk about it and isn’t proactive about his mental health. 

I really don’t know what to do about it at this point. I feel like I’ve tried so many different things and end up just feeling like his mother and nagging him to get off the computer. 

Advice?

TLDR: my bf won’t stop playing video games."
3536,relationships,"Depressed (but medicated), unemployed husband (M~40) talks down on me (F~33) about trivial matters and won't do anything at all to improve our situation.","TLDR: I work from home, DH is unemployed due to being depressed (I am too, but not to the same degree). Due to covid cutting back my hours, we had to ask for help from our parents in order to make rent and buy groceries this month. When I started making the groceries list this morning, he had an attitude with me about buying too many snacks which I didn't appreciate. It just isn't true; the snack ratio last time was 10% of the entire bill, and they were not just for me.

Hello, throwaway for privacy reasons. My depressed husband is treating me unfairly, and although I do my best to support us, he just games all day long and expects things to get handed to him.

It's been almost 2 years since he quit his job due to 'too much pressure', it took us a year to get him into therapy, and now he's being treated for it for \~6 months. Even though he says he feels better (which is great), it feels like pulling teeth to get him to do ANYTHING around the house.

It's all fallen to my lap; I take care of all the bills, the budgeting, the work, the cooking, and he just puts the plates in the dishwasher when he remembers, and games all day long (hey, I do too, but I also take care of my other responsibilities, or at least try to). 

This month, I could not make it due to my hours being cut (because many of my clients temporarily closed down), and we had to ask our parents for some help. It irks me, but he just doesn't seem to really care. He had an attitude this morning, concerning my grocery list that I would pay for with some money from his mom... He told me (talking down at me, as if I was a kid) that I could go ahead with my list, provided I didn't buy any snacks at all. As if I am a big spender-as if I COULD be a big spender, even if I wanted to!

I mean, come on. It was a pack of cereal for breakfast (for both of us, which we sometimes eat for dinner therefore saving money), and some bread sticks (as a treat). You do nothing in this house, and you get an attitude if I want to spend $6.00 for snacks that we BOTH eat, just because it was your mom's money that paid for it this time? Ideally it would be OUR money, but shit happens! How hypocritical can you be? 

I calmly told him that I didn't appreciate being talked to like that, asked him not to shout at me, and said that he could keep his mother's money. I felt like a jerk because even though he started shouting at me, he then got really quiet, which makes me wonder whether I am partly the cause of his depression.

How long before I feel like I am with someone I can rely on again, someone who treats me like an equal partner, who doesn't wanna behave like a teenager that has to be nagged at for everything, and also to be able to talk down on me as if they have some authority over me? The doctor said sometimes it takes a year of medication to get back to normal. Is that true? 

It's getting real tiresome, I'm ok when he treats me ok, but when he does stuff like that, I feel so done with it all... Has anyone's depressed partner gotten back to normal, and if yes, how long did it take them to get healthy again?"
3537,relationships,Should I (F23) see him (26M) again? Urgent.,"I need urgent help.

My ex boyfriend left me thrice and this last time came apologizing and said that he loves me and wants to see me one last time, I told everything he did to me and he was very upset but he doesn't say things like I will fix myself and I want to be with you etc, he accepts that he loves me and is sad that he hurt me but he doesn't initiate anything other than saying that we should meet one last time. He doesn't seem like he wants to get back together or wants to fix his toxic traits (as he abused me psychologically again and again) but is just uncertain all the time. I can't trust him anymore, and I thought that I had forgotten him, but I still feel excited and one part of me wants to meet him. What should I do?

TL;DR! My ex wants to meet with me one last time and wants me to forgive him in a way but doesn't directly say that he wants me back or he will change."
3538,relationships,My family [mostly 40’s and 50’s] rented a beach house next week in a remote beach town. I can’t decide if me [26F] and my boyfriend [28M] should go?,"Backstory: My uncle surprised my family on Sunday saying he rented this oceanfront house in a remote beach town for next week. It’s a massive house with a pool, 10 bedrooms, fenced yard, etc. There is a lot of space. We’d get our own King room, it has a private beach area, lots of lounge space, you get the idea.

All of my aunts and uncles live in the Midwest about 30 minutes from the main city. Their county has had 5 cases. I, on the other hand, live next to NYC in Hoboken. Hoboken has 563 cases as of May 26th. Not a lot, but also not a little.

I am so conflicted. My boyfriend and I want to go obviously, but I am concerned about the safety and health of my family. Since they all agreed to go, it seems like they aren’t worried. My boyfriend and I are though. While we’ve both practiced social distancing, show no symptoms, and overall are healthy, I’m worried that we could have it and give it to my family or they could give it to us.

Is there any way to make this safe? Yes, the house is huge, but my boyfriend brought up good points that 1) We’d all be eating together, 2) We’re all hanging out inside and 3) Who knows if someone would contract it when driving down. There are just so many unpredictable things. He and I are the only ones who haven’t confirmed we’ve going. The total number of people in my family going is 12. This all really sucks, my heart says one thing but my head says another.

Please keep comments as polite as possible. I understand people may strong opinions about this subject, and disagree with my family’s decision to rent this house, but this is why I’m asking for advice here. 

Thanks in advance for any help. 

TL;DR: Family rented massive oceanfront house next week. Boyfriend and I want to go but I’m worried about our and my family’s safety and health. Should we go if we can practice social distancing somehow?"
3539,relationships,My [29f] husband [32M] does not appreciate the things I do to make our home nice and I’m starting to become very frustrated.,"We bought a home last year and my husband is a very frugal person, so our home has looked kind of bare since. We got stimulus checks and since we have a little extra money, he agreed he would be ok with me buying curtains for the house. We don’t have curtains in any rooms except for one and it’s something I’ve been wanting for a long time.

Initially I was going to buy them online and showed him the price, which he was fine with. I found out today while he was at work that I could go get them from Big Lots for a cheaper price, so I did. While there I also got a piece of art for $40 since the walls in our bedroom are completely bare. Even with the art, I ended up spending about $20 less total than I would have spent buying just the curtains online. 

I spend all afternoon hanging these curtains and this art. It took a long time because we don’t have a drill (something else he doesn’t think we should spend money on), so I did everything by hand with my screwdriver, but I was happy with the way it looked and couldn’t wait for him to get home to see it. 

When he finally got home, he went into the bedroom but didn’t say anything about it. I asked him what he thought since he was being so quiet and he said “I mean, it looks good, I’m just surprised that money was spent on art.” I showed him our online banking statement and that I still spent less than originally planned, but he didn’t really have anything else to say. 

I’m pretty crestfallen. 

My back hurts and I spent my entire afternoon of my day off trying to make our house look nice and stayed within a $ amount he said he was ok with. Everything that has been brought into our house to make it look nice has come from my efforts. I put up these curtains, I’ve put up every one of the very few pieces of art we own. I picked out the furniture, the dishes. When something breaks like the toilet or a doorknob I’m the one that gets the tools out and gets on YouTube and figures out how to fix it.

I don’t know how to convey to him that I don’t feel appreciated, and honestly I’m starting to resent him for it. I’ve said the words “it hurts my feelings when you say stuff like that” yet this keeps happening. I don’t even need to be praised, but if he could just not shit on something after I’ve worked on it like saying the art I bought and put up was a waste of money, I would be so much happier.

Am I overreacting? If not, how can I bring this back up in a way that will make him understand that he’s hurting my feelings? It feels like if things were up to him we’d just live in an empty house with a futon on the floor and he’d like it better that way.

TL;DR: Husband makes no efforts to do anything to help our home look nice or well-maintained, yet only has negative things to say about my efforts. Why is he like this and how can I make him stop?"
3540,relationships,Gut feeling about girlfriend. Hiding her actual name for almost a year. Need advice,"
TL;DR It feels like my gf doesn’t tell me something. Is it she or my insecurity. Really need some advice 

Sorry for possible mistakes, English is not my native language. 

Me (17M) and my girlfriend (21F), let’s name her Jane,  met on the internet over a year ago living in different cities. We started as friends and became a couple last May. She moved to my city 3 months ago and we started to live together. 
The first thing I want to say is that she changed her actual name and surname to those that i know 3 months ago, and I’ve found it out a month ago. I’ll give more detail later in the text.

Some background:
So Jane is a communicative type of person that likes to chat with people and help them. She’s an ordinary girl in terms of social interactions, but in her teens she was quite shy and awkward. I mention this because she had no relationships or physical contact with other guys before me. It was kind of difficult to believe, but we both agree that there is no reason to tell something like that if it’s not true. She is also my first girlfriend. 

At the start of our relationship the main issue was Jane’s communication with other people. The thing is while we were friends I thought we were really good ones, but in fact there were a lot of people she chatted with just like with me. And it’s not about me being jealous, I couldn’t understand how she perceived me. When we became a couple she said that those people meant nothing to her and there were only 3 or 4 girls she considered friends, and she actually wanted to communicate only with me. 

Later on Jane says she doesn’t talk to anyone except me. I didn’t ask for it and didn’t want to limit her socializing with others at all, so her decision was strange to me, but I accepted it. And that’s where our main problem started. It was hard to believe that Jane communicates only with me, so I decided to check the online activity of a guy that she used to chat with a lot. Me and Jane were spending a lot of time chatting and whenever she moved away from the chat, even for a moment, that guy appeared. It was like second to second coincidence and it was happening all the time. I asked Jane about this and she said she had nothing to do with it. My logic was that if these are really coincidences they have to stop at some point. But they didn’t. So several months after our time to time arguing about this I decided to just stop tracking that guy’s activity. 

The first situation that really affected me happened in the end of June. We had a bit of a fight and didn’t talk for a couple of days. 

One night Jane texts me saying that she wants to make up. She was drunk which she didn’t want to admit at first. We chatted a bit and she disappeared for two hours. Then she texts me again saying she smoked weed (it was her first time and it offended me a bit cause we were going to do it together). So I started to worry, asked her where she was and she evaded the question for like 2 or 3 times. Finally she says that she’s at some guys’ house with her friend(F) and some other people. 

For some reason it really stung me. It even felt like physical pain in chest and stomach imagining my girlfriend drunk and high laying at some guys’ house. So i cut off all contacts with her for about a week. That week was hell. Then I realized that my attitude to that situation might be wrong so we made up. Jane sweared that she hadn’t do anything bad that night. She said that she called a taxi home with her friend some time after our talk. 
Later we discussed this situation a lot and Jane said it would be better if she just didn’t tell anything that night. This concept scares me. 

A month later it turns out that it’s not exactly Jane’s photos on social networks. She photoshoped her face, but it wasn’t done to deceive me, she did that long before we met. She felt really bad about it and was afraid to confess the whole time. I didn’t blame her and assured that everything was fine, especially considering that difference with her real photos was minimal. 

The next strange thing I remember was one of her voicemails. Jane was working nightshifts at tech support. On her way home in the morning she recorded a voicemail. In the end of the record I heard her quitely but distinctly saying “Let’s go” as if she talked to someone. I wasn’t suspicious about it.
I don’t mind Jane communicating with other people. I was just curious and asked her whom she was talking to. She answered there wasn’t anybody with her that morning. That surprised me a bit, so I showed her that message. She says she can’t hear any “Let’s go” in it and that’s not what she said. Now that surprised me a lot. But at that moment she manages to hear the phrase. “Probably i said it to myself”. Ok, no big deal, such things happen. 

I visited her on a New Year and during one of our conversations I recalled that message. I couldn’t read that dialogue from my account anymore, so I asked Jane to play the voicemail. The whole conversation was more in a joking manner, not like me being suspicious or something, but her reaction was really weird. She refused to do that by any means. The dialogue went from humorous to more serious one. I asked her why is she so protective, she didn’t find what to say, she just answered she didn’t want to play that message. Later she said that it is embarrassing for her to do it because I heard something wrong in the voicemail so she doesn’t like that situation. She evaded my objections and changed the topic.

Two months of living together. We get drunk and she says that she has something to say but can’t yet. 

In December she was invited to a corporate party but didn’t go. A month ago we got drunk again, I decided to ask her more about that party because something was strange about it. Let me describe the situation:

Me: “Do you remember that we agreed not to drink at parties if we are not together there?”

Jane: “Yeah, and?”

M: “Did you drink at that corporate party in December?”

J: “No, we have an agreement about it and it means a lot to me”

M: “So what was at that party?”

J: “Food, drinks. Some guy got drunk and wrote to our own tech support with threats”
My mood noticeably changes at this point

M: “Well, but you said you weren’t there”
(I f*cked up here not asking her what was she doing at the party)

J: “My colleagues told me. I even told you about an angry client that wrote *me* at tech support and turned out to be one of our workers” 
(she was working from home that month)

M: “You didn’t” 

J: *tells about that situation*

She starts crying as I’m looking at her silently. 

J: “I didn’t go to that party. I said what was there because I don’t remember what I’ve said you earlier and don’t want to make things worse”

I say I don’t trust her. Jane starts crying even more saying it’s over and she takes tickets home. I don’t react. Then she says she’s ready to tell me something (I mentioned that above) and after this “there will be nothing left that I haven’t told you”. 

She changed her name to “Jane” three months ago. She said she didn’t like her previous name all her life and couldn’t live with it. She perceived herself as “Jane” and not her actual name. She said she was waiting for the right moment and was afraid to tell me all that time. 

I understand her. But I also remember how I said she could tell me anything and I promise that we won’t break up and discuss it. I said that several times and every time she answered there isn’t anything she hasn’t told me, though she knew I felt really bad about the feeling that something is wrong. 

Remember the story about the angry client that turned out to be one of the employees? The next day after our talk I realize that Jane didn’t work the night the party was being held. So the client wasn’t able to write her. She said it happened at another corporate party then and she didn’t go to that party too. She just doesn’t remember such things because she doesn’t attach any importance to it.

So now I still have this constant gut feeling. The things don’t add up. Idk how to explain it. It’s like I’m missing something or Jane lies about something. The thing is I don’t have any evidence to prove anything. 
What bothers me is that Jane herself confessed only about photos and her name. The two things that I would inevitably discover by myself sooner or later. 

We’ve talked about this feeling a lot, but it doesn’t help. 

What should I do? Why is there this feeling and how to get rid of it? Is something wrong with me or it’s more likely that my gf hides something? 
Any advice would be helpful, thank you

Edit: I formulated the question incorrectly. I understand why i get this feeling, but have zero evidence until she tells me something herself.  Everything she is saying now might be true until I discover the opposite. So the gut feeling just ruins our everyday life for now. And the fact that I don’t believe what she says makes me think that something might be wrong with me. 
So the question is more about how can I get rid of the feeling? Or is there any way I can find evidence to what she’s saying?
Thanks"
3541,relationships,I'm [25M] texting a girl [21F] and my best friend [24F] is having an obsessive-jealousy-like tantrum over us texting,"I hope that the title is clear enough but the situation is following. I knew my friend for a long time, but only recently have we started actually talking so much (about 9 months now I think) that I actually treat her as my best girl friend. We are from the same city (capital of our country) and it is something very dear to us in our culture. Our city is basically ""our country"". However, I do live abroad for studies and we only see each other when I go home for vacation.

I've had my fit of liking due to constant chatting and I think she had one too, where shhe acted differently. But now I feel everything is back on track. As friends we are too close, perhaps even over the healthy limit which I should work on cutting down. There were no limits in our conversations, but we still supported each other in finding someone to nail - so to speak. She is basically the first person I ask for an opinion on something, or rant to when I'm having a shitty day. She also has a boyfriend now, and has had one before (another friend of mine, I connected them) so I don't know why she's throwing a jealous fit at me. 

Now, I mentioned we are from the same city and that city is the only place that is really relevant from all other places in our country to us. In our culture, we also dislike people from villages, probably because of a stereotype that they are usually uneducated, not well-mannered people, but I'm not that case.

I kind of like the girl I'm texting and we have been texting for a while now. Problem is - she is in another country (like, a third one) that is neighbouring our country. So, naturally, due to corona, I'm looking at ways I could get there when we decide to meet eventually.


Now, I talked to my friend about many girls that I've had dates and chats with, how they went etc. I never ""picked up"" any of those girls, and so probably she never had a reason to throw a jealous fit. BUT, she was always curious how it went every time.

Now, whenever I message her to talk to her about this girl, she hates the fact she is from a village and starts name calling her, raising her tone at me.

We now had a small chat-voice message fight, and I tried to calm her down. She kept telling me how she hates people like her, that I don't know her - so how can I like her, I never met her, I should be careful with girls like her, etc. Also, constantly mocking her birth place alluding she's worth less than someone from a big city per-se; but alongside all that, in a very angrily manner she told me a few times that she supports me and that if I'm happy she's happy.

Now, I'm not an idiot, I already suspected that she *might* be into me and that she's panicking due to the fact that I'm actually liking someone and it's working mutually apparently.

I sincerely hope this is not the case and that it might be something else. What do you think reddit, what should I do? I don't want to lose a friend, but I also don't want to stop chatting to this girl and potentially meeting her..

Tl;dr talking to a village girl, my girl best friend is throwing a jealous fit over us potentially mutually liking each other, without a good argument as to why it's not a good idea"
3542,relationships,F24 unable to date/heal 2.5 years,"

So I had bad luck with guys and now I am unable to connect to anyone.I feel kind of empty (sounds pathetic I know) 

I am extroverted and easygoing my last relationship was 2.5 years ago and it was(1year) bad he emotionally abused me, read my messages on my phone while i was sleeping, tried to turn my friends against me, made me feel bad about how i look and always made me feel guilty about something I sad or did. In the end I was afraid to say anything,had constant migraines and felt like an absolute worthless piece of s**t. Finally I realized that I don’t have to suffer and left him. 


It took a long time but I went on a date it was 11 month ago, but the guy ghosted me after I slept with him. Since than I had no “taste” for man. I am unable to convince myself to date someone or try to get close to somebody.  Sometimes I really miss to have a man in my life and I wonder about dating but when a guy actually approaches me all these feelings turn into disgust. Don’t get me wrong i don’t hate man i have male friends and coworkers who I really like. I just feel like I had enough of bad experiences and I am unable to date. I also feel like something is wrong with me and cant even imagine that a normal guy would want to date me. I just feel so broken. 

What do you guys think of this? I am started to think about going to a therapist. Have you ever felt like this?

TL;DR: I am unable to trust or connect to guys and it makes me feel lonely. I had too many bad experiences and don’t know how to heal."
3543,relationships,Should I see my Dad's Family on Father's Day?,"My (24F) mom (40) and dad(43) had me when they were both teenagers. He stuck around for about a year but wasn't in my life too much and then when I was four he disappeared completely for four years. He only came back into my life because his new wife found out my mom was trying to get her boyfriend at the time to adopt me. For the first couple years after he came back he was in my life consistently and I would see his side of the family pretty often too.

Once he and my first step mother divorced he started to fade out of my life again. I only saw him maybe once every 4 months and we never talked on the phone. This all changed when he met my current stepmother(36). He at first told her he only had two kids, my brothers from his first wife. Then he slowly let her know he has one more son from a previous relationship and then once they were together a full year he told her about me. 

I went to their wedding and it was fun being around him but I never really got close to her. She has a daughter from her first marriage that is 6 years younger than me and I managed to get close to her so that was the only good thing to come from my stepmother. 

From the age of 14 to 21 I saw my father 16 times. I moved in with him when I was 21 due to my mother and I not getting along ( horrible horrible mistake that I regret deeply). I thought our relationship would get better and it seemed like it did. He's never really been a father to me, just an older friend. 

I started dating my boyfriend at the time and they had no problem with him sleeping over or coming over whenever, they really like him and thought he was a good fit. When my ex cheated on me they both just shrugged it off and told me to give him another chance. 

My step sister (18) has always been a problem for my step mom. Bad attitude, lying, going out with her boyfriend who was 14 at the time. She moves in with my dad and stepmom and I and all of a sudden there is all these new rules. We both can't be out past a certain point, no bringing over random people, if we go somewhere then we must let them know where we're going. 

I never had a problem doing any of those things because my mom raised me to be respectful. I was an adult however so if I ever went out I would simply let them know who I was going to see and if I wasn't going to be home by 10 I just wouldn't come home. Flash forward a year to when I start dating my current boyfriend and they can't stand him. Never gave him a chance to show that hes a good guy because they just brushed him off. 

I would have him come over and we would hang out in my room and I had him stay over once because he was too drunk to drive home. He became homeless about 3 months into our relationship and I asked them if he could just stay here on the weekends sometimes so he could make sure he gets a nice shower and a bed. They said no because it's not in the rules. So I had him come over everyday after he was done with work so I could feed him and let him relax before he had to go sleep in his car. 

I'll admit that I snuck him over twice without their knowledge but I wanted him to sleep in a bed. Around the beginning of November I went out to dinner with my boyfriend and by the time he came to drop me off the temperature dropped to 35 degrees. I snuck him in because that's way too cold for him to be sleeping in his car and I was going to explain to them in the morning why I let him sleep over since they were both asleep when we got back. 

I got a text from my dad in the morning telling me I was the most disrespectful person he's ever met, he's going to hurt my boyfriend if he sees him and that I need to move out immediately. We went to my moms and stayed there for a week before my dad texted me to let me know all my stuff if outside and I need to come get it. Once we got all my stuff and moved back to my moms it was fine. I haven't heard from my dad since that day but I know he's been telling people I'm a bad person/daughter because I won't apologize and I won't talk to him. My stepmother would text me occasionally and tell me she hopes I'm doing okay and I would always just respond with ""you too"". 

She texted me the other day saying how she wished things were different and I finally got the courage to say ""I wish things were different too. I wish my father actually wanted to be my father."" She told me that he tried but I was too difficult because he was too scared to be a dad and decided he was just going to be my friend. 

I've now been invited to a cookout at my dad's sisters house on fathers day and all my aunts and cousins have been telling me I need to go but I don't know if I'm ready to see my dad yet. I know maybe I did some things wrong but I wasn't going to let my homeless boyfriend freeze just because they didn't like him. 

Also I'm sorry this is probably so hard to read because I'm terrible at writing. I just tried to get all of this out of my head.

Tl;DR Dad kicked me out because boyfriend stayed over and now we don't speak. I'm supposed to see him on father's day."
3544,relationships,My (22f) girlfriend almost never wants to have sex or be touched by me (22m),"I've been with my girlfriend for almost 2 years and we both love each other very much and are both more of less very happy together (no relationship is perfect) but in the entire time we've been together we've probably had sex less than 15 times. When we first started dating it was probably a good 3-4 months (can’t remember exactly) before we had first had sex, which is understandable. She then explained to me that her ex was quite forceful and borderline abusive when it came to sex which is why she wanted to wait for so long which I was perfectly okay with. I told her that I would never try to force myself upon in her in any way and that we'd only have sex if she was comfortable with it. After we first had sex we would then have sex very few and far between. We would go out together quite often (drinking, clubbing etc.) but whenever we would get back to my place she would always say how tired she was and she'd get straight into her PJs and go to sleep. After a while I asked why she never wanted to have sex when we got back from nights out and she told me that she was always too drunk (normally we both are) and just the same stuff she said about her ex before, I Didn’t press too hard cos I Didn’t want to upset her or make her uncomfortable. Anyways, as time went on nothing changed and we were still having sex very infrequently and even when we've taken trips away together she just shows no signs of wanting to have sex with me. At the start I would always try to initiate it and more often than not she'd reject me so I began to wait to see if she'd ever try to initiate it which she never did. I know she has some self esteem issues so I always compliment her and try to make her feel beautiful and sexy, I always try to be gentle with her but it never seems to get me anywhere. More recently she's become even less physical with me and hardly ever wants to kiss me or be touched by me and she tries to play it off in a jokey way but I find it strange. If I try to touch her in a sexual way she always just says she can't because her vagina hurts. I completely understand that she had problems in her past relationship that aren't easy to get over but it just makes me wonder how long it will be before she is comfortable enough. I get annoyed at myself because sometimes the situation makes me resent her a little bit which makes me feel shitty. I've even wondered if she just doesn't find me sexually attractive. She rarely compliments my appearance and if she does it's always just ""you look nice"" or she calls me a beautiful boy which is quite nice lmao but nothing she says ever insinuates that she wants to rip my clothes off. I love her very much and can see myself being with her forever but how long can someone realistically be in a basically sexless relationship.

TL;DR GF of nearly 2 years never wants to have sex or be touched"
3545,relationships,How common is it to not have each other's presence on social media?,"My (30F) boyfriend (31M) doesn't have me on social media at all. I posted something earlier. But it got me thinking, I am also nowhere to be seen on his social media and he appears single. We have been together for 1.5 years. All his friends on the other hand do have their SO's on there. I do not need him to write me posts about his love for me on there or anything like that. But a complete absence seems odd to me. 

How common is this? And it is immature of me to like to have a photo of us together on there?

&#x200B;

TLDR: How common is it to have no signs/photo of your SO on your social media?"
3546,relationships,Do you think he's lying or cheating?,"We've been together for 7 months, I go over his place once in a week or twice now it depends, he's not sexually active like before (he hasn't been always like this, he used to initiate since we met although i used to meet him almost everyday) he doesn't even get an erection when we make out.


We stopped having sex for almost 2 months, when i asked him if there's anything wrong he kept telling me that he doesn't masturbate or anything and he hates how he feels after masturbating.

I doubted it because for the last 2 months, i used to find lots of tissues squeezed together next to his bed  (i think it's because he wipes his semen after masturbating and sleeps before throwing them in the trashcan)


Last time i asked him again if he masturbates and he insisted he's not!


I think he masturbates a lot i keep finding these tissues every time i go to his place


I don't know if this counts or not, but we had sex 3 days ago and it was completely dark in the room we couldn't see each others' faces so i think it might be another significant



I don't know why he's lying about this and what's the big turn off? I need your help guy.


Tl;dr
My boyfriend hadn't had sex with me for almost 2 months, he tells me he hates masturbating, he masturbates and lies to me."
3547,relationships,"I heard my parents (mid 40s m&f) bashing my relationship (f20,m20) to other relatives.","For background information, my boyfriend and I have been in a committed relationship for 4 years. We have recently moved in together. We are not engaged and we will not be rushing into marriage. My family is primarily LDS and our relationship is not seen as a valid relationship according to their religion, from what I understand. 

Over the past few weeks my parents have begged my boyfriend and I to watch their dogs so they could go to a cabin with other extended family members. It was for Memorial Day weekend which also falls on my birthday. We both said no because we were planning on doing something for my birthday and didn’t want to be tied down to dog sitting. 

That was until my mother called me hysterically crying because she missed her family and really wanted to go but the dogs weren’t allowed. I eventually gave in to calm her down. She offered us to stay in their house (we live a few towns over) specifically their bedroom because it is the only one that has a bed for two. 

The night they left we drive over with our things prepared to spend the night. We arrive at the house and it is filthy. I’m immediately inclined to clean it up because that’s just what I do, I clean things no matter what. While I’m cleaning, my boyfriend is tending to the dogs. Once I finish cleaning I go out to the car to grab a few things to bring into the room where we’re staying. 

It’s locked. All the bedrooms are locked. I’m confused because it had been offered for us to stay so we didn’t have to make multiple trips constantly to check on their dogs. (We cannot bring the dogs to our small apartment) I call them thinking it must be a mistake. I was rudely informed it wasn’t. 

They both were yelling at me over the phone how we don’t need to stay in their house and use their things. I was shocked. I don’t want to be here in the first place, I’m watching your dogs FOR FREE, and you don’t want me to stay there instead you want me to drive for hours everyday to check on your dogs. I was obviously really hurt and not to mention frustrated. I wish I had known that before I cleaned their house. I informed them I couldn’t do the driving and they would have to find someone else.

I wish I was kidding when I tell you their response. “No, we won’t find anyone else. Thanks for watching the dogs.” They hang up. My brother then calls me and tells me to mute myself. I proceed to hear them rant to all of our extended family about how much me and my boyfriend disgusted them. 

They mentioned how we are living in sin, saying he won’t propose to me because I’ve already had sex with him, judging our tattoos/piercings, making fun of my boyfriends job (he’s a manager at an auto shop), and they topped it off by saying that’s why weren’t invited for family pictures (which I learned is what they were doing up there). 

I eventually hung up because I was just shocked. I never knew that is how they truly feel. I continued to take care of the dogs that weekend and we stayed at a friends house instead of theirs to save gas and time. I sent my mom a text and told her that I heard what they had to say and I will not be doing anything for them anymore. 

This isn’t the first times they have been that nasty toward me. I am honestly through. This was the last straw. I have been trying to distance myself from them and their beliefs hence why we moved away. They have been blowing my phone trying to apologize but I don’t forgive them. I don’t want to subjected to their scrutiny anymore. 

The point of this whole thing, how do you cut off a relationship with your parents as an adult? I no longer want them in my life but I feel I may never escape them. It’s gotten to the point where I would like to be removed legally from them if that’s even possible. 

TL;DR I was trying to do a favor for my parents but I overheard them going on a smear campaign about me and my relationship. They have done this throughout my life and now I’m done. I am now wanting to sever ties with them but not sure how to."
3548,relationships,My Bf (28M) and me (25f) are at a cross roads. Break up or move to a new city I don’t want to be in.,"I have been dating my Bf(28M) for almost 5 years now. Lets call him Matt. We met in college and have been living together for two years. We have a dog together and he truly is my best friend. 

He is like my other half and we are (for the most part; every relationship has its ups and downs) very happy together. 

I mention all of this because we are basically married. We act like an old married couple, we plan our future as if we are married, and we plan financially as if we are married. 

But we aren’t. I want to get married, he says he’s not ready. This is important because technically we have nothing binding us together. No child, no mortgage, no debts. 

My problem is this: Recently, Matt applied to a position at a military base as a higher up engineer. He has been offered a position that pays very well and has really good benefits. 

At first I was very excited for him as this is a huge opportunity for him right out of grad school. It’s a two year contract and this could be a huge stepping stone for his career and financial success. However, I am now stressed out of my mind about moving. 

This military base is in a very small town in a state I have never wanted to live in. In the past he actually asked me where I would want to live and my exact words where “ idc, as long as its not in bum fucking ( state that the job is in)”

I have been internally struggling this this move for a few months now. He is fully aware of my feelings but keeps telling “we are a team” and “this will be a great start for our lives together”

However, we are not married. This job is a great opportunity for HIM not for US. We split everything; groceries, rent, etc. Jobs in my field are very limited in this city and it’s a full 2 hours away from any major city. 

He said he’d be willing to not take the job but I know deep down he doesn’t want to give this job up. And truthfully he is young and just started out and I don’t think he should have to. 

Though it may be irrational, I fear if I move with him I may lose valuable youthful years and years I could use building a strong career for myself. That I may resent him for putting my career and future on hold. 

Especially at my age, kids are something that I always thought I would have in my late 20s. 

He wants me to move with him still and I just feel like if I move with him I am not being true to myself. This little town holds no value to me other than him. Should I move to a state I never wanted to live in for a great job opportunity for my Bf? Even if it costs me unhappiness? 

To me, this just feels like a make or break decision. Like one of those pivotal moments in life that changes our trajectory. Do I chose the person I loves happiness or do I chose my own?

Should I take this as a sign we should spilt and live our own lives? 

TLDR: Long time BF has great job offer in state I don’t want to move to. I feel if I move with him I may sacrifice my own career prospects and success. Choosing between my unhappiness or his."
3549,relationships,Mum said i'm wrong for telling Child Support that I 'suspect' my ex partner may be working.,"Recently I applied for Child Support and the agreement is he gives me **16 a fortnight** (he is/'was' on goverment payments/centrelink ($1,000 fortnight).  I'm not sure if he is still on it now though. 

My ex never see's, and _hardly_ calls to talk to the kids and the last payment I got off him was _before_ i applied for CS and he transferred $150 to my bank on the 21st of april. Since then I have got nothing, not even my CS. 

I recently seen on his Facebook page and instagram that he is friends/following a concreting business(my ex would always get concreting jobs throughout our relationship. So thats why i'm assuming he has a job. Also, because he seems to be buying alot of new things/getting new clothes/hair cuts. He is even talking about getting a new motorbike. He is also friends with the boss and the boss's wive on instagram/fb, another reason why I suspect he has a job with them. 

So today I rang CS and told them that **I suspect** my ex is working and they said they'll call him and I also gave them the company name to where I think he may be working, he'll just deny he is working anyways so nothing will probably come out of this, anyways(I don't think?) 

I told my mum what I did and she is fuming and even called me a snitch and that I shouldn't have called child support over such a low amount of money. She said ""**you never call the goverment and dob in people, thats wrong, i'd never do that. Especially not over $16 and you don't even know for sure if he is working, just leave him be and move on** 

Was I wrong? Also what will CS do now that I've told them I suspect he is working, what if my ex denies he is and it turns out he _is_ will CS investigate? My mum has made me regret what I did

**TL:DR - was it wrong that I rang CS telling them i suspect my ex is working without any actual proof?**"
3550,relationships,Did I make the right choice?,"Hello everyone, 

I’ve (F, 21) been dating my boyfriend (23) for about two years now. We work at the same job, doing completely different things, but my coworkers occasionally bring up how he’s flirting with our other female coworkers. Usually when I hear stuff like this, I blow it off because I trust my boyfriend. But today, someone brought a situation to me and showed me video proof. I watched a girl I had previously told him I didn’t like for this exact reason feeding him candy, getting really close to him, and positioning her hands towards his crotch on camera. He leaned into her face so closely it looked like they kissed. I was extremely hurt and embarrassed. So I brought it up when I came home from work, which led to him to start laughing and telling me I’m crazy and I’m insecure. He said he can’t believe I still don’t trust him after two years and that they weren’t doing anything in the video. I feel like another girl shouldn’t be feeding you anything and why would her hands be near your private areas? Doesn’t make sense. I felt completely unheard and like my feelings were invalidated so I broke up with him right there on the spot. He immediately called his parents, told them I broke up with him and started packing his stuff in our house. He took our bed, our toilet paper, everything. He threw all my stuff on the ground, broke our picture, just went crazy on me. And here I am thinking maybe I shouldn’t have said anything. I can’t stop crying. He basically told me that he’ll have his half of the rent next week and that’s really the only reason I need to contact him. I just feel like if he really loved me, he wouldn’t have reacted that way. I’m just so hurt. Did I make the right choice? 

TL;DR: caught boyfriend on camera really close with another girl which resulted in him saying I’m crazy and insecure instead of apologizing and telling me what I saw wasn’t what I think it was. So I broke up with him. He’s started moving all of his stuff out and I feel miserable."
3551,relationships,"My girlfriend (18F) of 1.5 yrs lied about seeing her ex, am I (18M) overreacting?","Hey Reddit. Just want to start by saying I really appreciate any advice you can offer me as I’m young and probably naive when it comes to dating.

Anyway, a few weeks ago my gf was at the lake and her ex (who lives nearby) happened upon her and they talked for an hour or so. I do not think this was premeditated (she goes to the lake frequently, this time her ex happened to see her there), and her ex was the initiator. Still, we’ve had previous arguments about this ex in the past, where she ultimately promised to not hang out with him, and limit talking as much as possible.

Back to the lake. She didn’t tell me anything about this incident, which I would’ve liked her to do, so I knew nothing of it for weeks. Then, a few days ago she mentioned a friend growing a beard in a group chat, I asked her who, she made up a story about someone she talked to in a one-time Zoom call and quickly changed the subject. Well that didn’t sit well with me, and long story short, after a bit of back-and-forth she confessed that she was referring to her ex, and told me about the lake incident. She said she didn’t want to tell the truth because she was afraid I would get mad, and “nothing happened anyway.”

I got pissed off immediately and am now seriously considering breaking up. I feel that she a) didn’t have to have such a long conversation with her ex in the first place, b) should’ve told me immediately after, and most importantly, c) definitely shouldn’t have lied about it. Another indirect factor is the fact that she has refused to see me during quarantine because she doesn’t want me to infect her parents, yet she was still okay with talking to her ex. Regardless, I think she has severely damaged the trust in our relationship.

Am I overreacting by considering breaking up? How would you react? Thank you!

TL;DR - Gf talked to ex (not pre-meditated, but still breaking a promise), did not tell me, and then later lied about it."
3552,relationships,I’ve only been with one girl my entire life. She wants to get married. Feel like I’m missing out on life but I’m scared to lose her. Is it time to call it off? (19M).,"
So I’ve been with my gf at the time for 2 years. I went to an all boys school so I pretty much had no interaction with girls in my high school years. I met my gf through social media (we had mutual friends). I thought she was very pretty and tried extremely hard to get her and finally did. At the start of the relationship everything was good, I was still trying to impress her and was extremely attracted to her, started imagining us getting married etc. 

Fast forward 2 years and the relationship is kind of getting boring to me. I still love this girl to bits and am still attracted to her, she is definitely wifey material, but I feel like I haven’t experienced anything. She wants to continue dating until we get married and I don’t want to sound arrogant but I feel like she really does deeply love me. 

The problem is I haven’t even talked to another girl yet in my life so Idk what it even feels like. I feel like I’m missing out on a big portion of life. All my mates are chatting to many girls and stuff and I must admit I find girls at university really attractive. I really have urges to chat up girls but obviously I don’t because I would never do that to my gf. 

My problem is that if I continue being with my gf until we get married, then ive pretty much been with only ONE girl my entire life. I just can’t get that out my head and I feel like I’ve missed out on so much. Forget having only one gf in my life, I haven’t even talked (flirtatiously) to another girl besides my gf ever. 

I would call it off but I really don’t want to let this girl go. I feel like she’s so perfect for me and I really want to wife her. But I just want to experience what being single feels like. If I break up with her and we both go our separate ways then I’ve lost a girl who was super wholesome and in love with me and I’m scared I’ll regret it. If I don’t break up with her and we end up getting married, then I’ve pretty much gone my whole entire life only talked to and been with ONE girl. I just feel like I’ve missed out in so much, but I really don’t want to lose this girl forever.

Such a fucked dilemma to be in. What do you guys think? Do you think if we break up for now, there’s still a possibility that we can get married in the future??

TL;DR - only been with and spoken to one girl (my gf) my whole life. Feel like I’m missing out but scared to lose her forever. Should I end it?"
3553,relationships,How do I [31F] tell my friend [30F] that I'm not okay with her visiting anymore?,"Sorry in advance for potential wall of text, I'm really struggling with this.

I've been friends with Beth since college, and she's a truly great friend. I won't make you read a whole ramble about it, but suffice it to say that this friendship means a ton to me, and I don't want to nuke it if I can help it. Normally, we try to see each other once a year or so (we haven't lived in the same place since we were about 25), but it's been over 2 years since we've seen each other due to life circumstances. In November, I moved to a new city and the plan was for her to come visit for a week in June.

Since we made this plan, there have been some complications:

* I was supposed to be on an intensive project with a new client this month, but due to the crisis' impact on the client's business, it got pushed to June, overlapping with part of Beth's visit. This would be my first solo project and will mean the difference between my getting promoted this year and not. I was told about this in March, and immediately let Beth know that I wouldn't be able to take vacation during the four weekdays she'll be here like I originally planned. She said that was fine, and she'd entertain herself during those days. Fair enough.
* My city was one of the hardest hit in our part of the US, and hasn't even started to look at easing restrictions. There is absolutely no way I'm going to be able to take Beth to see any of the cool things the city has to offer, or frankly even really do much of anything outside of our apartment. Again, I relayed this to her several times in the past month, saying that I think we should hold off on a visit until things are back to normal and she can have the full experience. She brushed it off, saying we could cook and go for walks.
* My husband is now working from home 90% of the time as well. Our apartment is less than 800 square feet, only 3 rooms. I work in the guest room and he works in the living room/kitchen combo, because we have so many meetings that we can't be in the same room without disturbing each other and the bedroom doesn't have room for anything except a bed. Bluntly put, things have already been stressful and tense with the two of us together in the apartment 24/7 and no breathing room, I'm not really looking forward to adding a third person to that mix for a whole week. Not only that, there's noplace you can be in the apartment without being in earshot of everyone else, so Beth and I wouldn't even have a chance to have a one-on-one conversation without an audience unless we were walking around outside.
* I already have a chronic illness. It's nothing that (to my knowledge) puts me at higher risk of dying were I to get infected, but I already have a lifelong set of health struggles and complications to think about, so I don't relish the idea of potentially adding more (lung damage, etc) to the list.
* Frankly, my stress levels and depression are through the roof right now, as I think most peoples' are. I can barely bring myself to function like a human being at work most days right now, let alone play hostess (no matter how much Beth insists that I don't need to do so).

I'm at my wits' end because every time I try to gently bring any of these things up with Beth, she brushes me off. Twice, she's literally said something to the effect of ""nope, I can't talk about this, I have to pretend that the world will be back to normal by then"". Okay, I get that, but it's now three weeks away and I still can't get her to engage on this. She's clearly not taking the whole situation as seriously as I am, probably partially because her city has had far fewer cases. She's started posting things on FB about how this isn't a big deal (not the ""it's a hoax"" stuff, more ""we all need to accept some degree of risk and get on with our lives"" stuff). I love her, and I don't want to make things worse for her (because I know she's also struggling a ton), but a) I'm just not okay with the risk of someone staying in close quarters with me after going through two international airports right now, and b) the idea of having a third person stuck in this apartment 24/7 while my husband and I try to work sounds stressful enough that I've had more than one panic attack thinking about it. How do I make this clear to Beth and get her to engage on this without destroying our relationship?

&#x200B;

**TL;DR Friend is determined to go through with our planned visit despite the pandemic. I now have a work conflict and our city won't even be open by then. How do I firmly tell her we need to reschedule without ruining our friendship?**"
3554,relationships,"6 y relationship ended yesterday out of lying, cheating and behaviour issues","I (26 M) ended my relationship with my ex (24 F) yesterday after reuniting with her again for a year. We first ended back in December 2017 after 4.5y together because we both had behavioural issues. I was verbally abusive, aggressive, and wanted things my way. She had strong lack of attention, laziness, immaturity and deep communication problems. We stayed apart for 2 years before reuniting again in April 2019.

In this period we stayed apart we both were extremely hurt and realised there was no way we could continue together because we both had to deal with our own problems, and mature to become better individually better. I focused heavily into therapy for 1.5 years, older trusted and mature people advice, religion, solid friendships and a support group. She decided to go to a foreign country for a exchange trip and English training for 6 months and there she said she was changed for good, but never committed herself with any therapy, or any behavioural or communication advice from anybody.

After she came back from the exchange program we still had the same friends group and eventually got closer. It was obvious to everybody we still loved each other and had strong feelings for one another. One day we had a one in a lifetime encounter, we had a sincere talk, cried, asked for forgiveness from our mistakes, expressed things we never shared, and it was a very sincere life changing event for our relationship. Since this date we got even closer and although we had some sparks here and there, we talked to our families and I asked her parents for forgiveness for my behaviour in the past, our friends continued to support us coming back together and that's what we did. In April 2019 we were back as a couple.

After we got back together I was slowly realising she didn't really changed. It was truly a mistake to get back together, she portrayed to be a completely different person coming back from her 6 months trip. She was visually changed and she could really convince that she had really changed while in her alone time immerse in a completely different culture, but she really wasn't. She just got back with the same behavioural issues, the same or even worse communication problems and she even got jealousy issues with a female friend who had and still has a boyfriend till this day.

As time went by our problems from the first time we were together started to face and new problems were put in the table. She decided to go to a voluntary trip to the amazon forest to help locals in need and there she met another volunteer guy, felt in love with him and even mentioned to her tutor that she wanted to stay and live with him and do volunteer work for life. While in the trip she constantly ignored my messages, saying it was lack of service in the woods, but she could post pictures no prob everyday. I just felt she was acting weird but we never had betrayal history or anything like that..

When she came back from her trip she felt guilty and told everything that happened to me. I instantly felt sick and cried and decided to go home. She was like another person to me. She was even still feeling ""jet lag"" but in a different way. She was still attached to the other guy and couldn't decide what she wanted. Me or her life in the woods with this guy she just met for a week. And then I went of to my car and there she entered my car as I was still in shock with everything that happened and couldn't start the engine. We stayed sit there just crying. And after several minutes I just hugged her and said I forgive her. And she promised she would work things out and completely forget about the guy.

After that moment trusting her was very hard. She still had him in her social network, he would still talk to her occasionally up until 3 weeks or something that she completely blocked him and she never mentioned him again. But trust was never the same. She still had strong lack of attention, lack of empathy, laziness, insecurity issues, jealousy when there was clearly nothing and general immaturity, not being able to sustain a grown up relationship.

She would still refuse to put herself into therapy or communication tutoring, she basically never did anything to improve her behaviour issues and become a better person. She would hide things from me saying she thought I would react in a specific way. She would constantly put herself into trouble at work because she couldn't communicate well and her clients would complain about her. She would only say she was sorry after every single fight we had and promise to change whenever she felt we were about to break up and put herself into her knees and beg for forgiveness but in real life after I had forgiven her each and every time selflessly she would do nothing to improve and act different.

It was up until this week that things really ended for us. I was in the hospital with my mom letting her into a room to be taken into ICU because she was not getting better from home treatment for covid 19 for the past 2 weeks. I asked if she could stay with me on the phone because it was going to be a very difficult situation to face alone. I asked if she could call me twice a day or just send me supportive messages, but she said that she wouldn't have any time available to help and be present for me because she had her post graduate orthodontics training to take that week and she was supposed to be busy from 7am till 5pm, but I left the hospital at 8pm and she didn't say a word about how we were doing and if my mom was really taken into ICU.

That only showed me how little she cared for me. But then when I thought things couldn't get worse I found out she lied to me saying she had to take this course, but instead she was selling a online English course all day and wanted to beat the company selling records as she was performing really good. The only way I found out about this is because her selling report was shared onine by somebody in her family to congratulate her on being the person that most sold English courses that day.

That was it for me. She left me alone taking my mom into ICU and couldn't even text me to give me courage and support while she was selling English courses online. She lied about not being available to be there for me and this was her last lie. We had a huge argument on how she never changed, on how us coming back together was the worst mistake I've ever done. On how she refused this whole 6 years together to search for professional help for her behaviour issues while I took no extra time to spend 1.5 years on therapy and get my shit together. She cheated on me less than 3 months we got back together, she would constantly lie about things, hide things from me, and act out of immaturity.

We broke up yesterday after several, infinite times I openly forgave her of her mistakes, after 6 years waiting for her to improve on herself and completely letting go the cheating, the trust issues I had after the lies, and just negotiating what was never to be negotiable in a adult relationship, just because I loved her to death. And I thought she would be my wife in the future and the mother of my child. I am here today, still deeply in love with her, still suffering like crazy, still having to face my mom being put into ICU and I don't know what to do.

TL;DR:
broke up 6y relationship yesterday because of cheating, lying, behavioural issues, immaturity, and communication problems but still deeply in love with her. I dealt with my behavioural issues for a 1.5 years in therapy and became a more mature man but she refuses to treat her problems after 6 years. To make things worse my mom is in ICU treating covid 19 and I feel completely lost and I don't know what to do."
3555,relationships,"Me [34 M] with my Wife [31 F] of 12 years, How do I engage her pessimism?","The wording of my title may be a bit confusing - sorry, I couldn't think of a better short hand for it. Basically what it comes down to is that, while I understand she doesn't always need my help 'fixing' things that she wants to talk about I don't know how to engage with her on certain subjects without being 'optimistic?'

As an example - she is studying to become a CNA and the place she's studying at has a 95% pass rate. She's incredibly comfortable with about 80% of the material and relatively good on the rest. She tests tomorrow and I've been helping her study. She is convinced she's going to fail. All day yesterday when I was helping her study she was talking about how doomed she was and how it all seems hopeless. Don't get me wrong - I understand that the potential to fail exists - she could freeze up during the test, have a stickler teacher, or get a bad assortment of test scenarios and screw up. It could happen. But it seems like those are the outliers. But she only sees those potentialities.

Obviously in scenarios like this I shouldn't respond with ""Sorry"" or ""That sucks"" - agreeing with her pessimism isn't helpful. But me trying to explain how good her odds are or pointing out that if she fails she can study and try again (up to twice again with different teachers administering the test and different test scenarios that she may be comfortable with), plus if she failed entirely it would suck but wouldn't be the end of the world.

Me being confident about her odds upset her. She says she's not like me and capable of just being confident about things working out but I argued that it's not about blind confidence - it's about the odds. In most outcomes she's good, in most of the outcomes where she fails tomorrow she's good within a week. In none of the outcomes where she fails completely is our life impacted in a major way - it sucks but it's just not worth stressing about. It led to a fight that we resolved relatively quickly but the question remains - what am I supposed to do? If she's being super pessimistic neither of us think that just... ignoring it or agreeing with it is helpful, but trying to help does nothing but frustrate her as well.

---
**tl;dr**: Sometimes my wife gets pessimistic. Neither of us wants me to 'support' that mindset but she also doesn't want me to try and 'help' either which leaves me feeling like there's no way to engage."
3556,relationships,I (23M) moved out of home after my mum (62F) verbally abused my girlfriend (21F),"This has been stewing in the back of my mind for the past month or so and now with a quiet night to myself I'd like to put it out there for any advice or personal experiences that anyone may be able to share.

I (23M) have lived at home with my parents for all of of my life. In 2016 my dad passed away very suddenly and unexpectedly, and up until early April of this year my mum (62F) and I continued to live together in our family home. We didn't always see eye-to-eye, but we've always been relatively close. When my dad passed away we both had different ways of dealing with it; where she had the family gather around her and focused on her own passions I preferred the company of friends and to spend a fair share of my time alone. Although we were both getting used to the new family dynamic of a household of two and changes to our everyday home lives we somehow slowly drifted apart from each other, no longer being as close as we once were.

In July last year I met my girlfriend (F21) and after quickly becoming very close my mum and I discussed her coming to live with us as her own at-home family dynamic always sort of left her as the odd one out. In February of this year she moved in and all seemed to be going well with her getting on well with my mum, her feeling more comfortable in a different household dynamic, and overall helping to make the home feel a little more lively again. Within a month however issues started to arise with my mum and girlfriend both being from very different family backgrounds and having quite different personalities. My mum has always been very particular about our family home as she made it into what it is with my dad, and where she is always very tidy and clean my girlfriend is a little more relaxed and somewhat forgetful; often leaving drawers or the fridge open by accident and taking a few days to pick up her dirty clothes from the bedroom floor. Where my girlfriend is very casual about humour and her family often likes to make harmless fun of each other my mum is not good at taking a joke and is offended very easily. The only things that I feel that my mum and girlfriend have in common beyond their interests are that they are both quite sensitive and rather stubborn.

By early April and well into our country's lock-down for Covid-19 we were all having issues within the household dynamic:

My mum was always having mood swings and would go from being totally fine one minute to being in the most foul mood the next. She would always be pulling me aside to voice her grievances against my girlfriend ranging from complaining that she was lazy, careless and rude to accusing her of trying to push my mum out of my life, wanting to take over and redecorate her home, and talking about her behind her back. I would try to explain things to my mum like how my girlfriend has always been forgetful ever since being on medication for depression and that her jokes aren't snarky stabs at her, rather that she is from a family where that is the norm. I never brushed away my mum's concerns, but I would remind her that my girlfriend's actions and behaviors aren't intentional but rather the result of how she was brought up and what she is used to at home.

My girlfriend on the other hand was growing increasingly anxious living with my mum and I; she was always on-edge waiting for my mum to have another angry outburst and often felt like she had to tip-toe around everywhere to not upset my mum. She would often have anxiety attacks at night where she would cry for hours on end and would often talk to me about her concerns with my mum's behavior - towards me in particular, and how she would like us to look into moving into a place of our own. Something to note is that my girlfriend doesn't have any friends of her own, outside of work my mum and myself were her only source of interaction - with the further exclusion of her work once the lock-down started.

As for myself I was just having a hard time trying to keep both my mum and my girlfriend happy, I would often feel caught in the middle trying to hold things together and would increasingly often just try to find relief by playing video games with my friends online. I hated the way that my mum and girlfriend couldn't get along and worst of all this caused me to start doubting my feelings and future with my girlfriend as as they say ""your mum knows best"". 

After a while though I started to feel more and more that my mum's behavior was the cause of the tension within the house. Her mood swings would become ridiculous with me seriously wondering if she was bipolar. She would walk around the house slamming cupboards and snapping back at me with the most awful tone, and when my mood would begin to reflect hers she would act totally normal and ask why I was in a bad mood and say that I had no reason to be annoyed with her. If my girlfriend and I gave each other a hug and my mum saw it she would accuse me of being inconsiderate, and if caught hugging or doing anything remotely affectionate in our own room with each other she would stomp in and pull the door closed with a slam. However at the same time if we were in our bedroom with the door closed to have some time to ourselves she would later complain that we 'shut ourselves away' and question why we were even living there if we didn't want to interact with her. 

Even I can see that this behavior likely stems from the emotional pain of seeing my girlfriend and I in a budding relationship while she is still mourning the loss of her own, but her moods went even beyond this. If I came home after a horrible day at work and in a bad mood and was short with someone my mum would call me out for taking out my frustrations on others, I would recognize this, quickly apologize and take some time to unwind. If my mum came home after a horrible day at work and in a bad mood and was short with someone if I made a comment about it I would be met with total hostility, told that how dare I judge her in her own home, and that if I didn't like it we could move out. My mum would hold grudges and be in moods for days, and when she did finally come around she would never apologize for her actions or attitude. Perhaps one of the biggest things too is that she is never able to be wrong, and I mean never. Even while growing up during arguments with her my dad would tell me to just accept that it was my fault and apologize, not because I was wrong (although obviously sometimes I was), but because ""she can't be wrong and she won't accept that she is"". 

There is so much more that I wish I could add but this post has grown so long already. One thing I will add though was how often she would bring up how my girlfriend and I could move out, every single time she was in a mood or started an argument she would say ""you two don't choose to live here, I *allow* you to live here"", or ""you two don't have to live here, you can quite easily move out"". Often as arguments would calm down she would change to ""believe it or not I actually like you two living here, but if you two want to move out that's up to you"". My mum has always known that the idea of moving out has terrified me, and I feel like that's why she brought it up so often.

So this brings us to about a month and a half ago, mid-lock-down, one night my mum comes into our room while my girlfriend is in the bathroom and gives me the ultimatum that I need to ask her to move out within the next three days otherwise she'll ask her herself and ""in front of me"". I told my girlfriend about it immediately and we decided that as soon as the lock-down was over that we'd both go flatting together instead - which is something that we had already been considering for weeks. The next day I had volunteered to help a local businessman cut firewood for his landscaping company (while adhering to lock-down work protocols, of course) and when I got home I could already see that things were tense with my mum in a matter-of-fact mood and my girlfriend doing her best to be calm and collected. Comments were made about me earning money and how I still needed to pay some money back to my mum for some expenses that she had helped me with while I wasn't working (we're talking about a couple of thousand) and I made the comment about how I wouldn't be able to pay her back as much as I had been (one third of my paycheck each week) once we go flatting as we'd have other expenses too like rent and groceries.

*and     shit     hit     the     fan*

What ensued was an absolutely horrible evening. My mum let rip but almost entirely at my girlfriend making comments such as ""you are the nastiest bitch I have ever met"" and that ""I hope my son meets a really nice girl one day who isn't you because I don't want you as a daughter in-law"". My girlfriend decided that she had had enough and was moving back to her parents's house immediately, as did I, and we instantly began packing up everything we owned. For the next couple of hours we loaded our cars, all the while my mum harassed us asking for our house keys and telling us to hurry up and get out of her house. At some points she wouldn't allow my girlfriend back into the house and instead threw her belongings out onto the brick path, she yelled in my girlfriend's face and at one point my girlfriend yelled back, and when my girlfriend finally broke down in tears my mum said to her face with a mocking tone ""aw is wittle \[girlfriend's name\] gonna cry now?"". Throughout this whole thing I amazingly managed to stay relatively calm, but I'm not going to lie that it took a lot for me to not go through that house like a fucking tornado. After a few hours we managed to get 80% of our things out and with the help of my girlfriend's dad we got it all back to their house. Her parents were nice enough to take us in and we've been staying with them ever since while we wait for the flat that we are going to move in to become available. 

In the time since then I haven't spoken to my mum all that much, I've been back to the house a couple of times to collect more things and the atmosphere has been a bit like that between strangers. She contacts me like nothing has happened whenever she needs something and one time when I called her to ask for advice about car insurance she was rather nasty about it and made the comment ""well it's real nice that that's all that you called to talk about and didn't even wish me a happy mother's day"" and hung up, even though it was over a week before mother's day. She's also made contact with me a number of times to talk about a repayment scheme that she's writing up with her lawyer to have me pay back everything she's ever paid for me over the past four years and with interest even though a legally binding agreement was never formed, and we are now looking at tens of thousands rather than just thousands.

And that's pretty much where it stands. I'm angry and I'm upset because I don't understand how things with my mum have gotten this way, with my dad the three of us were the most incredibly close family and now he's gone and things are like this. I'm angry at her for how she's behaved, and I'm absolutely appalled at the things that she said to my girlfriend - no one should speak to anyone like that, and definitely not a 62 year-old who's welcomed their son's 21 year-old girlfriend into their home. I don't want anything to do with her for a good while to come, and even though that's my decision it upsets me. It's her birthday on Thursday and although I don't want to do anything a part of me says that I should.

I appreciate anyone who has taken the time to read this absolute novel, I've been bottling this for well over a month and sometimes you just need to blast the shit for the world to read. Does anyone have any advice or personal lessons to share from similar experiences? 

tl;dr - My mum and I invited my girlfriend to live with us and after the new household dynamic didn't work out with my mum's mood swings and nasty behavior she verbally abused my girlfriend and threw her things onto the footpath so we moved out. Advice or similar experiences?"
3557,relationships,"I (21F) have extreme jealousy issues with my boyfriend (22M) of two years, how can I fix it?","My boyfriend and I have been together almost 2 years and the biggest issue in our relationship is jealousy. I understand it’s normal for him to have other girl friends but it just makes me so upset, I don’t even want him to be friends with them. I really do love him but my jealousy issues are consuming me and ruining our relationship that I so badly want to fix. We also are in LDR so it makes my jealousy even worse. For example, he hung out with a couple guy friends the other night and one of his friends brought two girls over and I was angry and crying the whole night. It gets to the point where I threaten breaking up with him even though I know i don’t want to end things. My last boyfriend cheated on me twice with someone he referred to as “just a friend”. I also have very bad self esteem issues and we have broken up before so all that on top of LDR make me go crazy with jealousy. I want to fix that so if anyone has any tips on how to not get so crazy I’d really appreciate it! 

tl;dr - I have insane jealousy and trust issues with my boyfriend and I feel like I am slowly ruining our long distance relationship. How can I fix my jealousy issues to make our relationship happier and healthier?"
3558,relationships,My Husband is Afraid of Tears,"My (34, f) husband (34, m) and I have been together for 5 years and married for 2. We get along great most of the time - few arguments, healthy disagreement resolution for the most part, etc. 

His biggest ‘area that needs improvement’ is that he doesn’t seem to know how to comfort me. When I cry (over anything other than a sappy movie) he gets visibly uncomfortable and makes THAT face (you know the one) of fear and confusion. This happens even if he isn’t the one making me cry. 

He will listen to me and hug me or give me a comforting rub on the back, but he doesn’t offer any verbal support or engage in any conversation/advice/supportive words. 

Now, I’m generally not someone who needs a lot of support but, like everyone, sometimes really shitty things happen and I need him to do more than hug me. 

Most recently I was diagnosed with a medical condition that effects our sex life and plans to conceive soon. I was having a BIG cry a couple of nights ago. He hugged me and listened to what I had to say but didn’t say anything back. I went to the bathroom to blow my nose and take some space from him b/c his reaction was making me more upset and when I came back he was asleep. 

This happens with other things too — for example both of my parents are just all around pieces of work and anytime I’m having an issue with them he has the same response. 

I want him to tell me it’s going to be ok, we’ll get through it together, ask questions, seem emotionally invested in my experiences. 

How do I help him help me? I think it just doesn’t come naturally to him to be comforting -  can he learn?

Tl;dr: My husband doesn’t know how to properly comfort me - how do I help him learn?

Edit: corrected typo “partners” to “parents”

Second edit: I understand the solution is to talk to him - hoping to hear from someone who has experienced either end of this about how I should approach it, how should I start the convo?"
3559,relationships,What do you people who are in relationships even talk about everyday?,"I am 30 years old and I have never been in a relationship.

I don't talk much to people. I just lose myself in my hobbies. But in between activites, I do feel very lonely. But that sometimes confuses me. Am I longing for a relationship because I am horny or because my genes urge me to? Or is it because I want someone to talk to? But what would I talk about beyond a point? As I said, I am bad at talking. Most of the times, it irritates me. I just want to get back to doing what I wanted to do or had planned to.

I realize that if the person had 3-4 hobbies/interests/ideologies in common with me, I can probably talk for sometime.



Tl:dr Does it get boring beyond a point to talk to someone everyday, especially when you don't have common interests?"
3560,relationships,"If my [22f] mom [42f] isn't the primary reason/inspiration why I'm doing something, she gets bratty.","She also gets like this if it's not her idea or if she overtakes something I'm doing to the point of where it becomes her thing not mine.

Mind you, I give credit where credit is due. If she was the reason or if she did inspire me, I acknowledge and constantly reasure it to high heavens. I'm talking about things that have little to nothing to do with her in my actions or decisions.

Sometimes it's not right when I'm doing something, like going out, creating, or working on something. Sometimes she just randomly brings it up later and pretty much acts like she's the primary reason I did something. When I admit she isn't she pretty much pulls the ""guilt trip, I'm the bad guy, you must hate me cards."" 

Mind you, one of the concepts she has EMPHASIZED while raising me is to not let people take over the things you do/want in life and to not take credit for something you had nothing to do with. When I respectfully discuss how she contradicts those concept she she tends to go into into an aggressive, pouty, sometimes crying fit and pulls out her cards.

Admittedly a majority of the problem is what I ALLOW people to do. There were countless times I caved in and ALLOWED her to frustratingly take over things that I wanted or had to be mine. School projects, stories, decisions to go out/stay, etc. But, in the past year and a half I haven't been allowing people's bullshit, hers included, and it's pissing her off. Up to the point of where she said, ""If I have to pretend to live in a world where my daughter loves me, so be it."" I think this was after I brought up how I didn't want to hang out with her co-workers because of college work I had to get done. There was a lot going on that night, though. I think it was a multitude of factors, tbh.

Half of the time I feel proudly justified in my stances but the the other half of the time I feel like I'm being ungreatful and mean.

TL;DR: My mom tends to get bratty if she's not the reason/inspiration for my actions, decisions, creations, etc., especially if they have nothing to do with her. That behaviour has increased since I haven't allowed her to be that way.

What do you guys think?? Any input is welcome."
3561,relationships,Is it normal to have doubts in your relationship?,"I don’t know if I’m (24f) just expecting a fairytale romance. I have been with my boyfriend (27m) for about a year. Sometimes I worry that there could be someone better out there for me. I don’t mean this in a mean way. When we go out to eat, there’s barely any conversation besides me trying. I wonder if there is lacking chemistry. I keep having dreams about my ex (broke up almost 2 years ago, dated for 3 years). I was crazy about him and felt crazy in love, I don’t feel that with this one. Is it just a sign of more mature love since the other one was my first love? The man I am dating now is a good friend to me, but I don’t feel super crazy about him. I care about him a lot though and I would be really scared and sad to let that go. 

TL;DR - Need advice... worried there is a better match for me? Or am I too idealistic?"
3562,relationships,I think my (30F) ex bf (31M) made a fake Instagram account to stalk me,"Over the weekend on Saturday an account called “@______memes” started following me on Instagram. I thought it was strange as their account was private, they had ZERO posts, 1 follower and was only following 40 people. As I was posting stories on my Instagram this  “@_____memes”  account was watching all of my stories within minutes of me posting them. 

I requested to follow the account but they never accepted my request. I also DMed them twice to ask if I knew who they were, which they read but never responded and left me on “seen.”

I started suspecting that it was my ex, as he and I were the only people who shared the specific humor of _____ type of memes together. 

I figured it could only be someone who knows me and is trying to keep tabs on my activity. I figured it could be my ex, as we unfollowed each other on Instagram BUT we never blocked each other either. 

Has anyone ever dealt with this before? Would someone really go through these lengths to keep tabs on their ex? 

Tldr; A suspicious private account started following me on Instagram and watches all my stories. I believe it could be my ex. Would someone really do this to keep tabs on their ex?"
3563,relationships,My ex is continuously stalking my life and it is effecting my future.,"Me(25f) broke up with my ex(27m) in July 18’. It was a rough break up, for him. It was also a terrible relationship I couldn’t want to move on from. Now I think to myself what the hell was I thinking, but I can’t go back so.. After finally getting away from him I was bombarded with countless phone calls. Which turned into emails. I’m not sure how many different phone numbers AND emails I eventually blocked. They finally started to slow down, and towards the end of summer 19’ they finally began to stop. But then I faced myself in other situations. Social media (Facebook, Instagram, etc) I can’t have one and feel safe at the same time. I even tried to make one under a different name and was still found. Reddit is the only site I actually feel safe to be on. I was being watched at restaurants, at work, at the food store. Followed in the car. Even my dad was watched one day. This was a few months ago. 
I’m not sure what to do as I don’t exactly have proof (video, audio, ect) if my life being threatened so the local police won’t do anything. 
It’s to the point where I’m thinking about packing up and moving somewhere else. Except the only thing keeping me here is I don’t have much family, but the family I do have is here where I’m at now. 
I was hoping someone has went through something similar and has some kind of advice...

TL;DR I feel trapped in my town because my ex is stalking me. I need advice."
3564,relationships,One of my (29/F) best and closest friends (29/F) is now dating my emotionally abusive ex (29/M) from five years ago knowing everything that he had put me through.,"If this were just a normal ex-boyfriend (one who hadn't emotionally abused me for years) I truly don't think I would care that my friend is dating him now. The thing is she was around for all of the abuse. I remember turning to her multiple times in the last year of that relationship and telling her everything that I had been holding in. She was there for me and she was supportive when I decided to seek help from a therapist. All of my friends were so good to me and so patient. I'll never forget that. 

I don't want to get into every little detail, but he basically isolated me from people, talked down to me in public and especially in private, punched holes in walls during arguments, left me on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere without my phone because I had asked if we could grab sushi instead of pub food on our way to a date once, always found new and cruel ways to let me know how ugly and undesirable I was, etc. 

This one time he was talking down to me at a restaurant, loud enough that another couple intervened. I was asked by the girl if I was okay and I remember just putting on a smile and nodding even though I had tears rolling down my face. Although that wasn't the worst thing that he had ever put me through, it sticks out a lot because it showed me that I didn't deserve what he was doing to me and that even a random passerby could see how miserable I had become. 

Anyway we broke up later that year and I got my life together. Now at 29, I've moved on. But of course I still struggle with some of the things that he had put in my head. I had no idea my friend was dating him until a week ago. Our friend group had scheduled a video chat. I noticed him in the background at her house, casually grabbing something from her kitchen before she gave him a look as though to tell him to move out of the shot. It was quick but I saw it and she could tell because she contacted me the following day to let me know what was going on. 

Although I respect the fact that she addressed it, I still don't get how or why someone could ever date the person that had pushed their friend so far over the edge. I would never so much as befriend a guy or girl who had hurt someone close to me, let alone date them. Even if he is a changed person (which she said he is) that doesn't change what he did. There are so many other guys out there that she could date. Why him? Maybe I'm being unreasonable, I just feel that it's a shitty thing to do as a friend. 

Not sure how to approach the situation or what to do moving forward in terms of our friendship. This guy basically tried to kill me once. We were arguing (more like he was shouting at me and I was taking it) in his car once and he started speeding down a busy street running through red lights saying that he wasn't going to slow down or stop until I apologized for having spoken up about something. That is the kind of guy we're dealing with here. Although he could very well have changed and grown to be a better person, those experiences and those memories don't just fade. Not for me. 

I don't even know what to say to her. Apparently they've been together since Christmas and he's been quarantining with her at her house. My main concern is her safety. What if he hasn't changed? He was good at pretending at the start and then when he felt comfortable enough the emotional abuse began and stayed throughout.  

How do I go about this? 

Thoughts?

TL;DR She knows he was emotionally abusive and she was there for me throughout, but five years later she's dating him and I honestly have no words. What does this mean in terms of our friendship? How do I handle this? I'm shocked by her decision but also concerned for her safety."
3565,relationships,"I (23M) and my gf (23M) have been together for 1.5 yrs. And for the past few month, we are non stop fighting.","Note: Its my first relationship

So basically, in the last 8 months we have broke off our relationship about 5 times, but we always get back together. The problem is she stalks if I am online or not and if ditched a message, and even though some fucked ip glitches or whatever shows that I was online while I wasn't, she doesn't believe and simply believes lets say fb messenger. Another issue is she doesnt want me to PM any girls as she feels that means something can happen between me and another girl. And also she always uses an attitude where she refuses to say the same thing twice and doesn't forgive/believe that I forget a lot, like she may tell me that she has some sort of ddl and then when K forget the ddl its like I dont care. And when there are issues that I see very minute and I am like please lets fight about a minute issue, like maybe me texting a girl without telling her, she flips crazy.

I tried to make her happy and she demanded more. Then I requested that whatever she requests applies to her as well to make her feel how I feel. And now, she uses a really bad attitude with me because I simply find her constantly upset and I feel like I am drained and dont know what to do with her to make her simply happy. And after every fight I wont forget this, I wont forget that, I dont understand whether she doesnt want to move forward or what does she want.

And I asked her if she wants to break up and she says no, I love you!!

I simply ask this:
1. What should I do to convey with her all the issues in manner that she accepts?
2. Should indulge that she keeps getting upset about every tiny thing?
3. Am I treating the lady incorrectly?

TL;DR my girlfriend is constantly upset and she doesnt want to break up. Its draining me, but I love her and dont want to break her heart. Am I misunderstanding something that is screwing everything up? Or are we simply not a match?"
3566,relationships,I (25M) am moving away from my girlfriend (29F) and the anticipation of a breakup is hurting both of us.," 

Hey all,

I moved to the city back in January for a new job, and started dating my girlfriend in late February. Due to COVID-19, I got laid off on the 1st of this month. When I took my job I'd intended to remain in that field for an extended period of time (and subsequently remain in the city I'm in now). My girlfriend helped me work through a lot of issues both professionally and personally, and motivated me to make the decision to go back to school to do things I love.

To elaborate on my situation: living where I do now is *incredibly* expensive. While I am able to cover my living costs until my lease is up (in August), it would be difficult to find another job I can do that both allows me to pay for my living expenses while saving for school. My parents have offered to let me move back in with them more or less rent free and save up money so that I'll be able to afford school. As a result, I'm planning on moving across the country to live with them at the end of August.

Here's our problem: We love each other, but cannot do long-distance. We've discussed this/the fact that it's likely we'll break up, and that we should enjoy what time we have left together. However, almost every conversation feels like it's dominated by the topic of me leaving. It comes up in half the conversations we have, and it brings us both down. It's brought us both to tears more than once, and made both of us physically ill. I'm worried that we're making things worse by staying together in spite of everything that's going to happen.  


tl;dr I'm moving in August, and feel like delaying breaking up with my girlfriend is adversely affecting both our mental health."
3567,relationships,My boyfriend [23M] for 2 years says that a voice in his head tells him that he doesn’t actually love me [22F].,"
Hi Reddit, this is going to be a long one. I apologize if the format is all scrambled because I’m crying so much I can’t think straight.

Today started off such a good day — we woke up and he kissed me good morning. We spent the whole day together laughing and teasing each other, having fun. Now all of a sudden I feel like my world has been shattered. 

2 hours ago he randomly said “we have to talk” and sat me on the bed. He says that he’s having strange thoughts in his head (he said it’s like a tiny “voice”) that tells him he doesn’t TRULY love me, and that he’s just with me because he can’t bare to see me lonely. He said that the voice tells him that he’s lying to me and that we should break up.

I’m so shocked. I asked him what he meant by that because he’s always told me he loved me? Were those all lies? Why would he feel like that? He said that it doesn’t happen to him always but when he’s alone in thought, that voice comes back and tells him that he’s lying to me, that he’s only with me because he’s scared he won’t find someone better. He says he argues with the voice and says that he DOES love me and he would do anything for me, but it always comes back and haunts him and he’s not sure how to keep it from me anymore. 

He said that he might be feeling this way because I’m his first girlfriend and he’s inexperienced with what “love” is supposed to feel like. He always thought it would be jitters and butterflies and nerves, but he said he’s never felt that way with me. He just feels “comfortable” and safe. He also said that although he feels the happiest he’s ever been with me, he still feels like there’s a hole inside of him. He said that what he feels with me is so different from what it’s like in the 
movies, he ends up questioning himself. 

He says he doesn’t want to break up and he just wanted to let me know that he had these thoughts but he would never act on it. He wanted ME to validate his thoughts and he asked me if I ever felt like he didn’t love me, and that if I ever felt like he was “hiding something”. I said no... and he seemed to feel better and more reassured that his feelings for me were real.

I’m just so confused on what to do. I feel like crap because now that I think back on all of our memories, I’m haunted by the image that when he looks at me deep in the eyes, he’s not looking at me with love, he’s questioning whether not he loves me. I don’t know how much of our relationship he was faking being happy. I don’t know how common this feeling that he has is either, or if this questioning is normal. I don’t want to be the person validating my boyfriends feelings for me... Are these thoughts potentially a mental illness? Or is he actually lying to himself that he loves me? Can this even be fixed with couples therapy?

I don’t know how to move on from this talk. I think that we should probably break up, but I don’t want to mistakenly break up with him in case he actually does love me, but is just blinded by “TV love” or by inexperience. I always thought he did love me from his actions... 

Please help reddit. Is this relationship worth staying in? 

TLDR; Boyfriend says that voice in his head haunts him and tells him that he doesn’t love me. He feels it’s because he always thought he’d get butterflies with his gf, but he never has them with me. We’ve never had any problems these past 2 years and I’ve always felt that he loved me. Should we break up? Is this a sign of a hidden mental illness?"
3568,relationships,I've been with my (f18) girlfriend (f18) for five months now but a part of me likes my best friend even though I have a heck lot of feelings for my girlfriend.,"I've been with my girlfriend for five months now (known each other for almost an year) We're in a long distance relationship, she's from the USA and I'm somewhere from Asia. It's not easy since our time zones are messed up and we only get the chance to talk with each other when it's night for me and day for her. 

The past few months had been crazy for both of us. We almost broke up, stopped talking for almost an month cause she thought we had broken up. 

Let's go like two months back where there was no communication between us two, even when there was it was all one sided. Me trying to communicate with her and she would takes days to reply and sometimes even weeks. It all started when she met this girl at the club and they hit it off, she would say they're close friends but sometimes I would feel insecure well because she would spend more time with her friend than she would with me in a whole week. Honestly I've never had any problem with her going out with her friends or hanging out with them, but it got to the point where we would spend no time together. I never asked her to give me all of her time and attention but just the bare minimum. 

So somewhere between the arguments she said she doesn't know what she wants anymore and disappeared again. I got tired of waiting around for her, losing my sleep every night and I decided to leave her a text saying that we should just end it if she isn't sure about what she wants anymore. After an week later I get a reply from her saying something like ""Are you serious?"" followed by another text from her friend (the one she met at the club) saying how my girlfriend came to her place drunk and passed out, we got into an argument about how i broke up with my girlfriend and that if I really loved her I would have waited for her. I really didn't mind waiting for her but I needed a reason back then to keep holding on to her and I never had any. I was left in the dark with no explaination or anything at all. So during the argument with her friend, she tells me how my girlfriend was hospitalised but she never really told me anything about her being hospitalised? Her friend even said how she doubts my girlfriend would talk to me again and that's she's already moved on.

So I was moving on and trying to go on with my life, and things were going well with me and the girl I liked? I've liked her for months since me and my girlfriend we're dating but i disregarded those feelings as an attraction between friends but oh boy I was so wrong, as we started getting closer and getting to know each other more I realized how my feelings were deeper for her than and I really wasn't expecting anything from her since we both were going through a lot with our past relationships but I went ahead and confessed my feelings for her but it wasn't mutual. She said how she can't have feelings for me or anyone at all and can't imagine herself being in a relationship for a really long time, not that i was expecting one but I wanted to know if we're on the same page. 

So of course we're still friends. After an whole month my ""girlfriend""? Texts me and apologies for how things ended between us two, we kind of talk about the whole thing that happened and how she really loves me alot and that she was confused if we're still together or not, to which I reply truthfully and tell her that we never broke up and I never wanted to but she just assumed and went on with her life without talking to me for a minute. She also tells me how she hooked up with someone cause she thought we had ""broken up"" and she expected me to mad at her but honestly I was just really disappointed and hurt over everything so after a whole week of talking we're back to how we used to be. 

A part of me still likes my friend, but I've accepted that I'll never be anything to her more than a friend but my friends say otherwise and talk about how she has feelings for me but not enough feelings to be in a relationship with me, but i feel like an asshole for still talking with her and being with my girlfriend.

TL;DR: I like my friend despite being in a relationship."
3569,relationships,Is it possible?,"I (22F) have been friends with this guy (22M) since we were probably 18 or so. We’re not the best of friends but I’d say we’re pretty close. But ever since I met him, I’ve always had this gut feeling about us being together. However, that has never happened and we’ve never done anything even slightly romantic mainly because when I wanted to make a move when we had first met, he ended up going out with one of our mutual friends. As far as I’m aware, they’ve been on and off for years now so I just kinda kept my feelings buried away cuz I love knowing he’s my friend and someone I can talk to. But my feelings about us being together haven’t changed or gone away. We don’t talk every single day or anything but he has visited me at school and we hang out when we can. I actually even asked him to go to my senior prom with me but something happened and he ended up having to bail. Still don’t know if he just wanted a way out but that’s in the past. So now, it’s like 4 years later and I still have these feelings but I don’t know if I should confess. I don’t know if he’s still seeing that mutual friend or ours and I also don’t know if risking the friendship is worth it.

TL;DR - I don’t know if I should risk it and possibly ruin my friendship with my guy friend and tell him I’ve had feelings for him for a while but never said anything about it since he had a girlfriend when I wanted to tell him. Not sure if he is still with said girlfriend."
3570,relationships,"Sexual harassment, manipulation and friendship in the workplace.","I'm a 30M bartender who hasn't been in a relationship since 2012. I haven't had sex since then either, plenty of opportunities just living conditions and honestly fear from abstaining for so long is a factor. Anyone the majority of my close coworkers are female servers/bartenders. Most of the cooks are male but I don't interact with them as closely. No time to small talk with the kitchen as much as the servers. 

Anyone who has worked in a restaurant knows that some level of sexual harassment is just part of the culture. The long term employees that have been working with each other for years are always saying dirty shit to each other. One of my closest coworkers is a 23F that is engaged to a former cook and has a child with him. I've always liked her and she knows it, unfortunately when I was younger and she was more or less single and fucking around I was a coward and never went after her. Of course years later she told me I should have  tried harder. 

We have a really strange relationship because we are essentially just close friends but she will grab my ass and rub up on me. I never touch her sexually because I'm not about that life but I've definitely told her straight to her face the shit I'd do to her and she plays along. She knows I want to fuck her and deep down in side I think there is some attraction to me too. I wrote a hilarious short story using inside jokes and sexual undertones about her and she told me she read it 4 times and she couldn't tell if she was wet from pissing herself laughing or being turned on. Whenever I see her out with just her baby she says shit like this could have been your daddy.

But she is loyal to her man and I would never want to fuck that up. I lost weight and gained some muscle and she told me I'm so much hotter when I'm confident. I even lent her some money for Christmas, that she paid me back. But not before she cut me a deal to give me some nudes in exchange to knock some of the cash down... this is wear the manipulation comes in. I've definitely manipulated other coworkers into giving me stuff like that. Some of them literally for free, and all of them in relationships. It makes me feel like a terrible person but my this told me the reason women do it is because I make them feel good about themselves. She told me they ""enjoy"" my sexual harassment. Which seems like a pretty slippery slope but it might be true. I don't give a fuck about their stretch marks, or weight or whatever I just tell them straight to their face they look great and eventually they are willing to show me. 

The problem with all this is now I don't know how to talk to single women anymore. It feels weird, like I would rather talk to my married coworker with 3 kids than a single girl who wants to fuck me. Not to mention my workplace might be just a unique environment, I could quit and go somewhere else and instantly get fired and catch a charge. So I guess the question is what do I do with my coworker, just keep it moving and stay friends and try to tone down my bullshit? How do I learn to talk to single women?

 TL;DR Female coworker is engaged with a kid but I am really close friends with her and she grabs my ass/rubs up on me and I verbally sexually harass her back but she tells me she enjoys it. I have manipulated nudes from other coworkers in relationships as well just by being nice to them and telling them they look good. Unsure of how to proceed/talk to actually single women."
3571,relationships,My girlfriend (22f) is unmotivated and it is beginning to get on my (34m) nerves,"We have been together four years next week.

I do love my girlfriend but she doesn’t really ever do anything. I think a lack of motivation and lots of procrastination is her issue. This has been the case since we began dating but I thought it was because of her age that she was this way. She is late to graduating college, takes two naps a day, and has issues with focus. When I come home I usually expect her to have dinner ready but often she has forgotten to cook and winds up apologizing. I’ve talked about it with her before on many occasions and it seems like she has gotten the message but it keeps happening over and over again. I know she is 22 but I feel as though she should have more energy for her age.
I’m at a loss at what to do to get her motivated and need help.

Girlfriend has issues with focus and forgets things often to the point where I’m irritated with her"
3572,relationships,I think my (25f) dad (44m) is in an abusive marriage with his wife (42f) of 15-ish years,"First off, my paternal grandparents raised me most of my childhood and I lived with my dad and his wife for only about 3 years (12-15ish) and I ended up living with my grandparents again afterwards mostly because of how badly she treated me, I never felt part of the family and felt like the odd one out since I was the step-kid. It was me, my dad, and then her and her two kids plus the kid they had together. So I was the only one without a blood tie to the rest of the family unit aside from my dad. I’m only just realizing the way she treated me when I was a kid wasn’t just unfair and bad, it was abusive.

My husband (30m) works with my dad at the same company and has been for about 5 years, so they are close friends at this point and talk quite often. My dad has been very stressed out lately, more than usual and he’s a really private person but will open up to my husband sometimes. My dad has been stressed out about finances and I guess his budget is way out of whack. Like $1800 food budget for 3 people a month crazy, not to mention all the other expenses they have. My husband was flabbergasted that we actually have more bills than they do and they have more income a month than we do, yet we have more extra at the end of each month. My dads wife just buys crap constantly and I guess if he tries sitting down and talking about it she will throw a temper tantrum and break things so he just avoids talking to her about stuff. And I remember her flipping over a coffee table before, threw something through the TV screen once, she threw her laptop like a frisbee down the hallway and they are hardwood floors so it shattered and broke. They can’t have nice plates, only plastic ones, because she throws them at the wall. So I guess she still does that stuff all these years later. 

Now my dads side of the family used to get together a lot. My grandparents, my uncle and his family, me and my family unit and then my dad and that whole family. But now my dad has no relationship with his brother because of some drama between them and his wife and my dad hardly has a relationship with his mom for unknown reasons. His excuse is that her house reminds him of his brother so he gets too mad so he just never sees her hardly anymore unless he needs to borrow money. Which they borrowed $2000 from her recently to avoid foreclosure on their house because they can’t pay their bills. My grandma told me this and my dad doesn’t know I know. She feels used for her money because they only paid half of it back and was venting to me about it. Which makes me mad because I know my dads wife just bought a used Wii and a brand new switch Lite just a few weeks ago for the daughter they have together who is like 13ish now.. But it made me realize she might be manipulating him into being distant from his own family because she’s been mad at me before and he hardly saw me or his newborn granddaughter for 2 years until just recently. My daughter is 3 so they missed out on her life from age 1 and most of year 2. My dad pretty much has no close family left because they’ve been alienated from him because she starts drama and doesn’t allow anyone to reconcile. I’m the only one she’s been unable to chase away for good probably due to the fact my husband and my dad work together, and because me and my dad are avid video game players so we talk in PSN chat almost daily. To successfully alienate me he’d have to get a different job (which he’s actually trying to do) and he’d have to quit his favorite hobby of playing video games which is the only thing keeping him sane right now I think. She’s super close with her family but to hell with my dad’s family apparently.

I hate seeing my dad so stressed out and anxious all the time. I wish I knew what to do and I’m angry this is happening. But I feel like since this is his 3rd marriage now he just puts up with it because he doesn’t want to deal with a custody battle again like he did with me my whole childhood. What can I even say to him? Is there anything I can do?

TLDR: I’m concerned my dad is in an abusive marriage with his wife who recklessly spends money to the point they might foreclose on their house, but when he tries to sit down and talk civilly about it with her she throws a temper tantrum and will break things in their house and yell at him so now he avoids talking about important things with her and is living with crippling anxiety and stress and is almost completely alienated from his family at this point. How can I help my dad and is there anything I can do?"
3573,relationships,"We’re (35M and 28F) fine when we’re alone, but socialising with anyone causes huge problems","TL;DR

Hopefully it’s ok to begin with a summary.

Ok, so that title immediately screams abuse. It is however rather more complicated and I really need some direction. I love this girl very much, I want a future with her, and I really want all of our issues to be mine so that I can get a handle on it, take responsibility and deal with each issue accordingly.

As things stand, we are in a toxic cycle. I feel my girlfriend is involuntarily manipulative, she may have BPD, she struggles to take responsibility, she is quite amazingly indecisive and constantly cycling between blaming me for everything, love bombing me and blaming herself. When we argue, she will often stonewall.

I am certainly not perfect. After an abusive childhood I have a temper, clinical depression, I’m needy and suffer bouts of low self esteem. After months of therapy a few years back I’ve got a handle on a lot of my own failings and can better manage my behaviour, but there’s no magic bullet.

In 18 months together, she has broken up with me during an argument 10 times. After each discard, she either apologises profusely or I do and plead with her to stay. I must admit, I am terrified of not having her in my life because when we are connected and close, it is the best relationship I’ve ever had. We understand each other so well, we care for one another, we make each other happy, and in her words “we are bestest friends”. I don’t want this to be another relationship that didn’t work out, I want there to be solutions, but I’m not sure there are healthy ones.

I’m going to break this down somewhat into bitesized chunks of crazy.

Some background:

My girlfriend and I met in September 2018. I’d not long left a relationship and was still dealing with my ex girlfriends drama. I wasn’t ready to start a relationship, but we text one another most days after an initial meet. We’d make each other laugh so much and genuinely didn’t think we were good enough for the other. We didn’t actually start dating until January 2019, but quickly got as close as we thought we would and things progressed very well.

She was living 60 miles away with her parents, I have my own house (that I’m in the process of renovating completely). We are both educated and experienced, she has a professional career and I’m freelance. She was desperate to move out and create some independence from her parents whom she described as ostentatious, overbearing and in the case of her mother, a manipulative little Hitler who’d lost touch with her first two children (she has 4) during a marital separation (there is a significant age gap between the siblings, and my girlfriend has never met them). It became apparent that her mother had held her back from pursuing university, and quite clearly had held on to her youngest daughter way longer than was reasonable. My girlfriend justified staying with them for so long (I moved out at 18 so to me, it’s unusual) because they had a huge house, and she was trying to save for a mortgage.

We fell in love, and as the months went by, she naturally began moving in with me. She found her commute to work from my place wasn’t quite as bad as she expected and she enjoyed living in the countryside location my house sits in. She didn’t impose herself, I was delighted to have her join me.

We got along well, cooked together, ate together almost every night, watched movies, walked for miles in the hills, we took a break away to go and visit my brother a few hundred miles away. We were a proper couple, and saw one another as ‘the one’.

Early summer 2019, the problems began. She had already warned me that she could become emotionally detached when other people important to her were in her company. She told me that she struggled to keep everyone close at the same time, and focussed quite intently on who she was with at that moment. This warning was given whilst en route to meet the only sister she has a relationship with. We met her at her parents house, and very quickly I could see my girlfriend withdraw from me and almost change to suit her sister’s personality. She became more brash, opinionated, materialistic. It was quite striking, I’d seen this before in an ex (I understand is known as mirroring?). That very evening, there was a disagreement during a political conversation and very quickly my girlfriend leapt to the defence of her sister, putting me down in the process and belittling my views. Rather odd, I hadn’t seen this before in her. Perhaps it was my fault for mentioning such a controversial subject. We discussed it days later and she agreed it was unreasonable of her. I told her that I needed more respect from her when in the company of others (acutely aware of her mother’s manipulative tendencies I didn’t want any vulnerabilities exposed in that household in particular), and we left it at that.

Friends:

She was invited to a ‘best’ friend’s wedding, and it seemed to be the only thing on her mind for what felt like months. There were two hen dos, one of which was abroad, dress fittings, meals out to plan, and the actual wedding itself. I wasn’t invited.

And then there was another friend’s wedding, this time she stayed over with me at one of my friend’s houses in town to be near to the venue. I wasn’t invited.

Parties, meals out, evenings in town, I wasn’t invited to any of it. We have been together for 18 months now and I’ve met her primary group of friends twice, once during a planned ‘introduction’ at a bar when we got together and again on her birthday in November. None of her friends have ever been to our house. It has left me baffled, and I feel like such an embarrassment to her. She has argued “that’s just how my friends are”, and I have argued “yes, but you are responsible for your interactions too”. Conversely, I have introduced her to everyone I know. She’s a popular figure in my village pub, has become friends with the friends I have here (I moved into this region 5 years ago so most of my social contacts are 350 miles away) and met those further afield during trips back ‘home’ with me.

One of her social engagements involved staying at her parents for the weekend whilst they were on holiday. We went to her parents house together and she then went out to see her friends, leaving me to sit for her parents dogs. By this point I was really beginning to feel left out and forgotten. We text one another that evening as she became progressively more inebriated before eventually telling me she was sick of me texting her, “my friends don’t have to constantly text their boyfriends when we’re all out. I can’t deal with your anxiety”. She then immediately ended the relationship with me over the phone whilst I begged her to be reasonable. She got a taxi back, blaming me for ending her night early, and on her arrival at the house shouted at me repeatedly whilst quite clearly still very drunk. Some of the highlights:

“You’re controlling”
“You’re making my life miserable”
“This level of anxiety isn’t normal, I can’t deal with it”
“Maybe I want someone else”

I sat there crying in bed, trying to work out why this person who loved me intensely 12 hours prior now wanted to have me surgically removed from her life as if I was some sort of tumour. I had every intention of getting my things together and driving home the next morning.

However when we wake, she apologises profusely. She didn’t excuse any of her actions and admitted she couldn’t treat me like this again, that she was desperate for another chance and pleaded with me not to end the relationship (that she ended the evening prior). She blamed alcohol for her emotional instability, and immediately swore to give up drinking. I suggested this was a major undertaking and perhaps just try moderating it, but she refused and said she doesn’t know how to.

Her sobriety lasted a few weeks, before admitting she isn’t going to stick to it and it was an overreaction of her to suggest this. Instead, she agreed not to drink around friends when we weren’t together as I am able to moderate her drinking for her when we’re together (her words). Come the next night out without me, naturally she drank and completely undermined her voluntary commitment to me. She denied drinking until the moment I picked her up and smelt it on her breath. Her excuse for not admitting this earlier (when we were texting intermittently throughout the night) was that I’d be angry with her. It caused a huge row.

Autumn:

Come November, we were asked to spend the whole month at her parents house to dog sit whilst they travelled Australia. I work from a laptop and her parents house is actually closer to work, so it didn’t inconvenience us too much. It was quite an upheaval and I must admit I find such change difficult to deal with, but it was temporary at least. As the weeks went by, she surprised me on the phone one evening during her drive back from work by telling me “I can’t treat you like I have any longer, I want to get help. I’m going to get therapy”, which of course I welcomed. I insisted that our issues were not all of her doing, that we each had a responsibility to solve our collective issues, but she insisted everything stemmed from her. I didn’t agree, and still don’t, but I welcomed her enthusiasm to seek some much needed support.

For the second time in our relationship, I was invited to spend the day with her and her friends to celebrate my girlfriend’s birthday. We went out for pizza, and conversation flowed between everyone until her ‘best friend’ (she has two) asked her “do you fancy a Nando’s in the week?” to which my girlfriend immediately responded with “sounds great!”. Now, this wouldn’t be out of the ordinary at all, if it wasn’t for the fact that I was staying with her at her parents place all month to dog sit. This would mean leaving me to it for the evening whilst she heads off to socialise with friends that are quite obviously not particularly interested in getting to know me. It struck me as really rude. Later that evening I asked her about this and she immediately responded with “oh I’m not going, I just didn’t want an argument”. Why on earth would saying “no” and reiterating the circumstances that they were already fully aware of or perhaps even suggesting “can my boyfriend come?” cause an argument?

We spent the immediate Christmas period with her parents. It wasn’t particularly enjoyable and the atmosphere was tense. We argued when away from family members fairly constantly. We drove down to see my family 350 miles away after Christmas, and the bickering was mostly non-stop. On our way home after new year, she reneged on her voluntary obligation to seek help, told me it was all my fault, that I made her feel that it was her fault, that it’s actually all my fault and I’m the one who needs help. She accused me of being manipulative and controlling.

Disney:

Her parents have been excitedly reminiscing about  Disneyworld holidays they had as a family right up until a couple of years ago. They asked if I would go, and insisted they’d pay for everything. I wasn’t comfortable with it especially, as the thought of spending two weeks with them fills me with dread. Furthermore, it felt rather odd that they’d take a 35 year old to such a place without children and at their expense. My girlfriend was desperate for us to accept the offer, so over lunch one day and in front of her parents, she mentioned it once again, knowing I’d have to accept.

This was scheduled for September 2020, but has been postponed a year due to the pandemic (thank god).

Lockdown:

We struggled through until March, when she ended the relationship whilst on a walk at the beach. She was tired of me talking about coronavirus, argued my suggestion that she should insist on working from home was controlling, and went on a tirade about how I don’t allow her independence. She told me that I am stopping her from seeing friends, family, that I’ve taken her away from her life, and I’m trying to turn her against her parents. I sat down and sobbed as I watched her turn on her heels and morph into the cold and heartless version of herself that seems to hate everything about me. We agreed to leave the beach and drove home. She packed her things and left. On her way to her parents, I called her and apologised for talking about the upcoming pandemic too often and tried to rationalise all of the arguments had about friends and family. I was freaking out and deeply afraid of losing her forever. She went from being very cold and distant to emotionally aware in a couple of minutes. It was agreed she’d come back and we’d try to find compromises that work for us, and that she’d have more independence, which translated means she’s going to see her friends and family more often and I will not be included. I’m not sure why she wanted this to be the case, she is my world and I want her to be included in my life fully.

Coronavirus takes hold and the UK gradually becomes one of the worst affected countries in the world. Lockdown happens, she is forced to work from home. Fast forward two and a half months and we’ve had the most peaceful period of our relationship to date. We have been getting on so well, we feel close, there’s very little to argue about (whilst the world is still a very stressful and scary place), we have no real qualms. We’ve been working on the garden together, watching movies, enjoying the sun, exercising and having a generally pleasant life. It is quite the opposite of most people’s experiences.

Today, we met her parents for the first time in months. Despite their desire to come over to the house, we insisted on abiding by the law and met them instead in a park halfway and would socially distance for the duration. The meet went initially quite well despite my girlfriend’s anxiety about their commitment to social distancing (she is now taking the pandemic very seriously), but I felt belittled toward the end. I mentioned that I wasn’t happy with a garden project I’ve been working on and said “I don’t want it to be perfect, but cottage like...” and my girlfriend interjected with “it’s not going to be perfect, hahaha”, giving her mother the opportunity to retort “well no it’s not going to be if you’re doing it yourself”. It felt completely uncalled for, especially since I take such pride in my work and have been working on property for my whole adult life. This particular property has become my career during lockdown since all of my clients have suspended operations. When I questioned my girlfriend about her retort on our way home, she immediately accused me of being over sensitive and refused to admit that she’d done anything wrong. She denied hearing what her mother said. That was 6 hours ago and I have kept myself busy since getting home, occasionally asking my girlfriend if she understands why what was said was hurtful, she has so far told me “I’m not going to apologise, it wasn’t meant to hurt you and you were over sensitive if it did. You were bound to be offended by something today”. I even went so far as to text her a link to a psychology site discussing why telling someone they’re over sensitive is unhelpful, but she refused to read it. I feel undermined, belittled and as if I have no recourse. I guess we’re back to square one."
3574,relationships,My mother wants me to take an online class for her.,"
My mom recently started taking online college courses. Yesterday she told me that I have to work on a assignment for her yesterday and I did it. After talking to her for a bit, she told me that she wanted me to take the whole class for her. I tried to tell her that I was kinda uncomfortable with this...... But she kinda brushed me off. This is sorta something she’s done as long as I can remember. Today she was fuming at me today for not working on her math work. There was other things she was upset with me about (my room being dirty, cooking the same food etc) but that was the biggest thing. I don’t really have anyone to talk about with this and I clearly don’t want to do this. But I’m scared she might retaliate in some other way. I’m really unsure about what I should do.... I’m 20 and with the whole pandemic there’s not a whole lot I can do right now.

TLDR: My mom wants me to take a online class for her. I don’t really feel comfortable with doing this."

Hi there,

I’ve been with my girlfriend a year come the first and I’m looking at creating some special gifts. I have already ordered some physical presents but some hand made gifts would be lovely.

Please drop any ideas for loved ones that I can base my ideas around for example a time line of all our important dates for example.

I know this is a personal question and only I should know what’s special between myself and my partner but some prompts never hurt anyone.

Thank you

3576,relationships,[22/M] My Head or My Heart?? A Quarantine Love Dilemma,"          Ladies and Gentleman I am currently in quite an emotionally taxing situation. I was in a long term relationship from High School till January of this year when me and this girl, we’ll call her J, broke up.Me and J have quite a complicated history,for example, we’ve broken up multiple times, I’ve been assaulted by her ex boyfriend, she has mental illness related issues which in the past have effected me, and I’m not proud of myself, but in the past I cheated on her... a lot... I was pretty much a sex addict and used sex as a coping mechanism for a lot of my problems( BOO,awful I know).But anyway in December I finally decided to clean up my act for myself and J so I spoke to a councillor, got a referral to a psychologist, and began talking to my friends about my problems. However it was too late and by January her trust in me and mine in her was broken beyond repair and alas as I stated earlier, me and her split. 

          Classic Break up I know but just wait because now it’s about to get a little Spicier 🌶. Time passes and as I’m talking with my friends and accepting and working through my issues, I eventually feel that I’m ready to date someone without hurting them with my dirty rotten disgusting cheating, and I begin dating this girl, she’ll be called M. M Is one of the smartest people I’ve ever met, with a literal 4.0 GPA and aspirations and goals that I could only dream of. She’s also been one of my biggest supports throughout everything I’ve went through and I honestly don’t think I’d be where I am today without her. However because of COVID-19 she moved back to her home town and I moved back too mine and we live REALLY REALLY far away. 

          This is when it turns into a ghost pepper 👻🌶. Throughout all this time I haven’t spoken to J, not even once , and then finally, a few weeks ago, me and her end up having a few brief conversations, she tells me she’s just started seeing a new dude, and she already knew about me and M. These conversations are entirely harmless in nature of course, however, since I’ve talked to her again I’ve felt my feelings for J grow and grow and now I truly don’t know what to do. I think about J constantly, I think of how I want her back ,how I wish I could have 1 more chance because now I know I’m in a place where we could make it work and I could treat her right. Idk if I should tell J how I feel or not, would it be fair to her to say these things when she’s started a new relationship? And what about M? She’s been instrumental in getting me to where I am today but my heart feels as if it’s screaming for J , and I feel as if ending things with her will break her heart, and if J doesn’t reciprocate my feelings, breaking up with M could leave me completely alone. This is my Quarantine Dilemma and I would really appreciate some help figuring it out, or at the very least, some honest advice about what to do

TL:DR. I’ve moved back to my hometown do to COVID and my feelings for an ex-girlfriend have returned and I feel as though I truly love her and want to be with her. However she has just started a new relationship and I am in a relationship of my own"
3577,relationships,Reoccurring disagreement with best friend (23m) and I (22f)- not showing enough interest in common hobbies.,"I (22f) am feeling  a little frustrated lately over the same situation that has reoccurred with my best guy friend(23m).  (We known each other 8+ years - non romantic,  he is my best friend). It is a piggy back off a thread I posted a while back about my friend thinking that i am not truly interested in few games or interests we have in common . Sounds childish but bare with me

One in particular is DnD-
We’ve been preparing to start a campaign; getting our characters ready, creating  the backgrounds etc but since then we haven’t played. So we agreed to play one morning but we both ended up sleeping in, leaving us with not enough time to play before we had to head out to work. 

Apparently this left a sour taste in his mouth and him expressing that he feels as though there isn’t / I’m not showing enough interest in playing the game, I say that I am but my actions don’t match because we haven’t played our campaign yet and procrastinating. 
if I truly wanted to play then it would of happened already whether it be the morning we had made plans or another time.   He also expressed he feels as though he is always the initiator in wanting play or to do something in relation to the game.  

So now he refuses to have any association with me in regards to DnD. 

I understand being let down when plans fall through , it happens and  that’s always a bummer so I get where he’s coming from in that sense.  I am hurt of what he said in regards to procrastinating or me being uninterested- I am very interested otherwise I wouldn’t be spending time buying,  building my character and other materials for our campaign etc .  
I will admit there are times where we could have played and didn’t. Majority of those times we would of only been able to play for an hour or two, which I expressed to him i didn’t feel that was enough time but he sees it as an excuse.    As for initiating yes i will take fault in not asking/bringing up more often. 
Anyways the whole thing is off the table. 

I don’t know how to show him or express to him that I am truly interested and I would still like to play with him.  If I ask him now he will say no or that I’m only doing because he mentioned something.  I hate to bring his GF into this story but the same situation happened with her and him,  funny enough over DnD too, but he still will play with her regardless.   

To a lot people it may seem like it’s just a game get over it and move on , but it something I (we) we’re for some time looking forward to start so it’s disappointing. 

Should I just let go and revisit it further in time?
Or talk to him?  Any helpful advice?

Thanks for reading! 

Td:lr  friend refuses to play or associate anything in regards to a certain game because he feels as there is no interest on my part. -I am interested."
3578,relationships,Dealing with my roommate's threatening BF,"Background: I'm a 25 yr old M and my roommate is a 30 year old M. We moved in last July and haven't really had any direct confrontational problems. We don't talk at all, and I can't stand his mess but I just keep quiet and clean up after him because I ultimately know he won't clean up. Our lease is up in about a month, and my plan was to move out and into my own unit in the same building but those plans are on pause because of COVID-19.

Anyways, he always has hookups over. I don't care, as long as they are clean and neat, because it is his space too and he pays rent and can have people over as he please. This guy stayed over last night and is still here right now. I went out to the store and came back and his suitcase was blocking the door, and I accidentally kicked it. He came out and cussed me out, screaming at me not to touch his stuff. When I told him it was in the way, he just kept screaming. I go to my room to do some work, and I hear him in the background telling my roommate ""catch me outside any f\*\*\*ing day because you need to be straightened out"",""I bet you stay in that f\*\*\*ing room until I leave"", ""don't call the police on me because I have friends in the police and they let me get away with this sh\*t"". He then told my roommate how ""if you ever have a problem with him to text me and I'll finish the job"" and ""you should put cameras in the hallway up so you can catch him messing with your stuff"". The messing with your stuff part is odd because I've never touched his things before, so I am not really sure where that came from.

Normally I handle confrontation well, but the friend is like 3 times my size. I honestly don't want to make it a bigger deal than it actually is. Any advice as to what I should do? I was thinking of talking to my roommate once the guy left.

\---  \*\*TL;DR;\*\* : I feel that my roommate's BF is threatening me and I feel uncomfortable in my apartment. I don't want to make it a big deal or anything, but I am concerned that he will do something. What should I do?"
3579,relationships,Not sure if I’m overreacting or not about what I (24f) found on BFs (25m) phone,"Gonna keep this as brief as possible. 

Basically about 2 years ago, I caught my boyfriend sexting another girl. He had told me they were just friends and I didn’t think anything of it nor did I care they talked. Then one day while he was at work he asked me if I could go on his laptop and send him something. He has messenger linked to his laptop and I saw a weird message pop up from this girl. I caved and I looked and saw they had been sexting here and there. I pretty much packed my shit with no idea WTF to do because we had JUST signed a lease and paid our dues. My boyfriend and our roommate ended up convincing me to stay and boyfriend vowed to be transparent and help rebuild the trust. 

It worked and went great, he never tried to hide anything and even though I didn’t want it he gave me access to his social media to prove he had nothing to hide. Eventually I knew we needed to move past this so I told him I think I can trust him again and let’s just move on. I don’t want to feel like I need access to your private social media. All was well. 

Yesterday morning his phone kept going off and he wasn’t waking up to stop it so I did and I saw a message preview from this old friend from highschool of his that he just recently started talking to again. At first I felt insecure because of what happened but he assured me they’re just friends. Ok. I let it go. But now this message preview I see it’s her telling him about a dream she had where he kissed her. Again I’m like FUCK and I cave and look. And she’s telling him in great detail about this dream she had where they were in a house and he kissed her and he did kinda disregard the kissing part n shit but then he asked her what the bedroom looked like. And her response was just a normal explanation of a bedroom and from there they just kept talking but honestly this all feels too familiar. I feel like it’s just a matter of time before this starts to turn into a repeat of what happened 2 years ago. I feel stupid for staying. I feel icky for looking. I don’t feel right. I haven’t said anything but I’ve been quiet. 

Basically I’ve been thinking since then that I should break up with him before this turns into round 2 but my friends are telling me I’m overreacting and that he didn’t actually entertain the kiss part. But they are talking MUCH more now and it feels like they’re testing each others waters. Idk. What should I do. Am I an idiot to think this is the extent of it, or should I listen to my gut and run now. 

Tl;dr caught bf sexting years ago, worried it’s about to happen again cause I found new messages

At my current job I work with people I really enjoy talking to but suddenly I’ve been paranoid over coming across like a weirdo

Long story short: my manager is a bit of someone who likes to stir the pot humourlessly, I love her she is great to talk to and get along with and she is really funny.

Recently a situation came up with a couple of my coworkers, she made jokes about how me (a guy) always gets attention off of them and said they follow me about. She meant this in a playful way, it’s her humour, she was making a joke.

I said this to them, as a joke, and they took it seriously. To the point where they asked me about it at a later date. To the point where they started telling other people about something they claimed I said legitimately

I basically explained to them that:
No I don’t think they follow me, and that id tell them to go away if I did actually think that. I Also said that it was my manager who made that comment and it was a joke.

Now I’m left in a state of paranoia where I feel like I look like a weirdo, or a liar etc.

This is really dumb I know but any advice, I feel like if I brought it up anymore I’d look stupid after already explaining it.

3581,relationships,My girlfriend (22F) for 3.5 years said she doesn't have feelings for me (21M) anymore.,"So I know this would be highly overdone and obviously this is nothing new. But this was my first relationship of my life and so this is really important. 

TL;DR: 
So this girl, (let's call her Shruti)and I have been dating for a long time but most of our relationship has been in long distance since we're in different colleges. But even through that, we were going strong. Ofcourse, being so far away from each other, we had our ups and downs. We met in different cities in between semesters because even tho we were from the same hometown, it was hard to meet properly during sem breaks because of our families. 

It had been 2 months since we had gone to a trip last but then I got a little busy with my academics so we lessened our daily conversation. 
So one day, all of a sudden she said that she wanted to break up because she was now confused about her feelings. And she needed time. She said that she wanted around 6 months to figure shit out. I asked why it was so, she said that things were getting monotonous. 

Now see, I admit that things actually were getting a bit monotonous. Because we weren't able to meet that often because of low finances and I had some busy semesters in between and also we couldn't spend our special occasions such as birthdays and anniversaries together. 
But I had planned a lot of shit for her this semester since I was free. I had planned to spend new year's, her birthday and our anniversary together.. Which we had never done before. But alas I kept it as a surprise. I even told her this stuff after she said what she said. 
Upon further questioning, she said that she had been feeling attracted toward someone else and she didn't wanna be cheating on me by feeling for someone else. She said she had not lost all feelings for me but they were disappearing. 

Then two months later of no contact with her, (I gave her her space), I find out from our mutual friends, that she told them that she had lost all feelings for me. I was obviously heartbroken. 
Nothing had ever been wrong between us. We didn't have any other issues. There were obviously some fights but nothing too big. We were always there for each other. 
I never saw something like this coming. It was too sudden. 
Okay so also she always says that she feels guilty for losing feelings and I had been just perfect. But I don't get exactly why she lost them. 

It has been 5 months now and she started talking to me again, possibly because of the lockdown. We live nearby too, so we met a few times. I've been helping her with her preparation for her post grad. I asked her again, if she had developed some kind of feelings, or anything. She said no. 
I still wanna win her back because I know for a fact that she did love me. I don't know what happened. It just did. 

Any suggestions or advice?"
3582,relationships,"Even though i am officially an 'adult' (30,F) i need to talk to an adult right now for some perspective 🙈","To start with, i (30,F) have issues which make it very difficult to actually know how i think or feel as i tend to over analyse and look at things from every possible angle and perspective and it just goes round and round till i drive myself crazy so I'm looking for some rational perspective! I have got talking to a guy (24,M)and in so many ways he fits the bill for everything i want and haven't found so far - lovely, kind, wants to settle down and live the quiet life, live the family life (i am a lone parent to my 16month old daughter), he is very understanding of my mental health problems and ticks so many boxes. However, i have alot of doubts and worries and i just need some perspective/experiences... We have very different lifestyles, hes a very heavy smoker, and a terrible sleeper, and doesn't eat/drink healthily at all. With my mental health problems and much of the last few years focussed on keeping mentally well and everything involved with that (eg exercise, healthy eating, good sleep habits) it really worries me. The thing is, he basically says that he's just been waiting for the right person to change the lifestyle for. I understand this but part of me feels like these changes should be for himself not for me/my daughter. He says that he couldn't do it for himself and he just needs that motivation of doing it for someone else. Is this red flags or is this normal?

TL;DR  is it a bad sign for someone to only want to change their bad lifestyle habits for you and not for themselves"
3583,relationships,My (26/M) girlfriend (26/F) hates my best friends and does not like when I spend time with them. This frustration is getting very serious.,"I guess first I should mention that I have a group of male friends that I have known for over 10 years now and we occasionally like to go out drinking with one another. All these friends of mine bring their girlfriends along when we get together. Well my girlfriend has never felt comfortable around these people. She never feels like my friends try to have conversations with her and I am aware of this dynamic as well so I can totally understand her frustrations. My friends have a tendency to want to talk about “guy stuff” and don’t really get the girlfriends involved in our talks a lot of times and my friends girlfriends are friends with one another but not that close with my girlfriend. I’ve tried a lot to get her involved, but she is just clearly having a bad time when we get together.

Well she talks negatively about my friends to her friends all the time and how she hates the “vibes” she gets with them. My friends seem to understand that my girlfriend is not a big fan of theirs, and over time they just decided that maybe it’s best not to invite her along when we do things (for her sake as well because she is clearly not enjoying her time). I think it’s important in a relationship to spend time with your friends so I have been continuing to spend time with these people (granted it is virtually in these current times), and she hasn’t been getting the invites and it is making her extremely upset. The way I look at it is that these people have been my friends for most of my life and I’m not going to cut them out of my life just because my girlfriend doesn’t vibe with them..but I guess she feels that she has been cut out of my group and that makes her angry. I’m not really sure what the best solution is. She doesn’t even want to go join in on these things but she gets upset that she isn’t getting invited, and I try to explain to her that she has her friends she spends time with and I should be able to have the same thing for myself. I really feel torn and extremely sad about this to the point I am in tears. I’m trying to be as understanding as possible but she is so angry and guilt trips me anytime I spend time with these people. Am I not thinking through this rationally? Does anyone have any advice on how I might need to change my perspective to really be more understanding? Am I in the wrong here in any way? Thanks all.

Tl;dr: Girlfriend justifiably dislikes my best friends. She gets very frustrated to not feel included. I don’t know if I am handling this situation in the right way."
3584,relationships,I (17 F) resent my sexist parents (47 F and 49 M),"I will be 18 in a month! The problem is that I've always been a sheltered child because of my sexist parents.

I have never been allowed to go to parties or hang out just because of my gender. My dad always tells my mom he doesn't want me to go around and have sex and that's why I'm not allowed to hang out. He thinks all women just want sex. 

When I turned 10, I wanted to join a boxing class but my parents said they wouldn't let me because it wasn't feminine and that my body would get ruined. When my brother (now 24 M) was 10, they fully supported him when he said he wanted to participate in a boxing club at the local multicultural center.

When I turned 14, my dad said that I would never do anything with my life because I would ""get pregnant and drop out of high school"" like my aunts. That made me cry. I was a 14 year old who knew nothing about sex and he was already ridiculing me. On the other hand, my brother was encouraged to be sexually active at the age of 14. 

When I joined the theatre extracurriculars at my high school, my dad was really discouraging of it. He told my mom, who recently told me this, that he didn't want to join the drama club because he didn't want me to ""have sex with the theatre kids."" I was committed to acting and I wasn't looking for sex. 

I asked my mom to let me hang out with friends during high school and she said ""not until you're 16."" But I turned 16 and they didn't allow me to do anything. 
They would let my brother do anything he wants just because he's a guy. They would let him hang out when he was 12. Meanwhile, I've only been to a non-school event ONCE, and that was last July. :( 

Now that I'm graduating high school and turning 18, I want my independence. I plan on getting my license within the next few weeks. I also want a job in the next few weeks. My parents don't want me to get a job because they can't accept that they are losing control of MY life. They can't accept that I want to take control of MY life as and become an ADULT. BTW I'm moving out when I'm 18 because I'm tired of being treated like a prisoner instead of their daughter. So I need a job no matter what.

I'm going to have a serious conversation with them about boundaries because they treat me like a 5 year old who doesn't know what's going on. How do I tell them to back off?

Tl;Dr: My (17 F) parents (46 F & 49 M) have never let me hang out of do things on my own just because I have a vagina. I am turn 18 in a month and I want my independence. How do I tell them to back off?"
3585,relationships,How do I (F27) support my boyfriend (M32) after a near death experience he had today?,"Hi Reddit, my boyfriend of almost two years is a volunteer firefighter. This morning, he responded to a call where a house was engulfed in flames with an old lady inside. At the direction of his chief, he and another firefighter went inside to try to rescue her. They made it half way into the house when the floor started to give way and he made the decision to turn around. They barely made it out in time before the house exploded. 

I FaceTimed with him for around 10 min this afternoon and I can tell that he is extremely shaken by what happened (understandably). He said that he doesn’t want to talk about it again after today to which I said was totally fine and that I’m always here if he wants to talk about it. He looked like he was about to cry at one point but turned the camera away first. There’s counselling services available to him through the department but he said that he doesn’t need them. In his words, he said that what he struggles with is the “what if’s” and thinking about everything that he could have almost missed out on in life. 

I’ve never personally experienced something like this so I’m struggling with knowing how to support him best. I want him to know that I’m here for him and would love to encourage him to go speak with a professional but I don’t want to be overbearing or suffocating. He’s been through a lot in his life with family/other scenes he’s responded to but this one seems different since it was such a close call. 

Any advice about how to support him would be super appreciated.

Tldr; Boyfriend almost died in a house fire and is visibly shaken. How do I as his girlfriend best support him?"
3586,relationships,"Good man, bad sex, old ex. Should I leave?","So. This is a very complicated situation, for me at least, for you it will be a very long story. Please help, I need advice. My husband and I are 27 and 28, we have been together for 6 years give or take a few months. 

 I have always been a highly sexual person, however, I didn't lose my virginity until I was 19. That being said, I wasn't as sheltered as my mother believed. I was well aware of sex, masturbation, porn and all the shame that goes along with it. I felt shame after every time I flicked the bean and I would generally do it any time I thought I had enough time to get away with it. I always viewed sex and relationships as this glorious thing that existed on the other side of a wall that was locked until you figured out how to date. I never had sex during high school because I thought all sex was as nasty and exposing as porn was, and I had a rough kink so I never wanted anyone I had to see on an every day to know all my nitty gritty secrets. I idealized long monogamous relationships and even though I had watched my parents fight their way through a long marriage with 5 kids in the mix I recognized that as my future. I thought that was love was for a long time, someone you didn't always have to like but couldn't imagine life without. 

When I did lose my virginity, I was 19yo and two days into the first relationship I had ever had and didn't even think the relationship would last. I thought if I told (we will call him Dustin) Dustin I was a virgin he would be afraid of me getting too attached and he would leave with my hymen still intact as others had. As it was, our relationship was what you would expect for someones first real relationship. I wanted sex every five minutes and we celebrated every ""monthiversary...Yeah, I know, cringey. He was good at keeping pace with me for the first few months but when things inevitably slowed down I thought he was bored with me or that I wasn't hot enough. I was a sex addict before ever having had sex though so it wasn't his fault, it was all on me, I was greedy, I didn't know how to be any other way. We struggled because it pushed a wedge between us, and made him want to spend less time with me. That relationship ended about 10 months later due to him texting his ex every day and me finding out by going through his phone. They sent daily ""miss yous"" and photos back and forth, and then I saw a photo of a drawing he had given to me. It was an outline of a buck surrounding a country girl he had given to me a few weeks prior, in the message to her it was a pic of an early sketch that said ""hey sweetheart, I drew you something."" Sweetheart was my pet name. After realizing it was a drawing of her and not just the generic country girl I believed it to be, I became furious. I told him I was done and waited for him to explain, defend himself, fight for me or anything. Instead he packed up his stuff silently and drove back to his hometown, leaving me with the pain of my first break up without having any closure from the fight. It took me months and a lot of alcohol to get over the fact that he didn't fight for me and that it seemed like he was perfectly fine while my whole world had caved in. 

Fast forward 4 months of almost complete celibacy, and constant drunkenness on my part, I met Ronald (fake name) in an old fashioned way: at a karaoke bar on my 21st birthday. He wasn't even close to my normal type, but I remember he had the best smile and seemed in awe of me. I had a ridiculously bad awkward phase in my youth and was still insecure about my previous breakup, and having never known what it was like to be flirted with or to have someone fall in love with me at the first sight, I let him buy me drinks. We had a few things in common as far as simple music tastes and both my friend and his were playing a strong wing-man/woman game and really wanted us to connect. I found out later that he had even gone back to his house to get more money to keep buying me drinks. I also thought that because of his weight (he was on the larger side) that he would be well endowed, and since ya girl here, is at heart a massive slut who hadn't had sex in months, I had sex with him on the first night. I had to convince him a little, as he was worried about moving too fast because he said he really liked me. I was a little drunk and very horny and ended up getting my way, as soon as he put it in however I knew something was off. He was very small. Like I had one of those moments of, oh no that's it? He was good with his hands and the sex-while not mind blowing, did the job and we both got off. We had a pretty decent connection and he was intelligent enough to hold a conversation but I know now I would have friend zoned him that night if I could go back in time. We weren't sexually compatible but he tried so hard to please me that I couldn't break it to him that it wasn't quite what I wanted. I couldn't break his heart. I loved him very much but I struggled early on even finding him attractive, so I started calling him handsome instead of babe or his name to try to change the way my brain saw him. It worked for a while and we figured out how to get past the awkward phase in our sex life, for a little while things were great. We really connected on a companionship level and ended up moving in together right around the 6 month mark. I had reservations about being with him, but we never fought, which I realize now that was more so because he had a tendency to overreact and I learned really early on how to avoid triggering him due to my issues with mental health. This sort of turned into me just not talking. That makes for another problem later. 

About a year into this new relationship, my ex reached out to me, I was gobsmacked. I never thought he would talk to me again, and I told him I had met someone and that was the end of the conversation for probably about 2 months. Then he started to reach out to me every few months for the next 3 years. I had this whole other life that played out in my messages with him, but because I didn't want anything to come of my old relationship, and wanted to avoid hurting Ronald I kept the fact that we were talking again secret. I felt so ashamed that I was even giving him the time of day, let alone deleting conversations and hiding things from Ron that I started looking for things in Ron that I hated. Everyone in my friend group and close family member hated Dustin, and that drove a lot of what I was feeling into the closet. I did my best not to get sentimental with Dustin in any of our convos but he constantly sent photos and asked for phone calls and I was weak. I have always been weak when it came to him. Life played out in this manner for a while but eventually it was too much for me and I told Dustin I was going to really commit myself to my relationship with Ronald and ended all communication with him. 

We didn't talk for a while, and I was doing better mentally. Ron had opened up to me about his sexual issues, he suffers from not only having a below average sized penis but also he had some external injuries that he had been too ashamed to tell me about. I was heartbroken again at the thought that he had been in pain after every sexual encounter and never had the guts to tell me. After doing some research I figured out that he had micro lacerations around the head of his penis, which caused scar tissue to build up because they never healed properly. PSA: If you have a cut on your dick, don't have sex for at least 6 weeks, this is what causes dicks to bend. Left untreated the way it had been for the year to year and a half that he didn't tell me about it caused the scar tissue to basically form a band around the entire penis. He soon was unable to achieve any erection at all without pain, and this caused our already depleted sex life to take a dive. Like I said, it took him almost 18 months to tell me he was even in pain. It took me another 2 years to get him to see a doctor, and when he finally did the doc told him to get healthy. That they couldn't even go about the surgery with him at his current weight, which, now and at that point was over 300lbs. Its been about 3 years since he saw that doc and not a single thing about his lifestyle has changed, except now we are married. His habits have worsened now by corona as he now has an excuse not to leave our room, though we never left it before anyway. Our sex life evolved over the years into using toys for me and kind of a round robin, he gets me off, I help him get off, its very give and take. I just don't know if I can handle the fact that my sex life depends on a vibrator (which is broken right now), and that I haven't been penetrated by my partner in just about 4 years. To some people that seems like a small hurdle to get over. In fact a lot of people (including my old therapist) look at us and think we have this super healthy happy relationship and most wonder why we don't have kids yet. Due to the nature of our issues and them primarily being his issues, I can't seek support from anyone and even when I confide in a close friend or family member I feel like I am betraying him. I can't talk to him about it anymore because it's a very sore subject for him, and emasculates him any time I bring it up. 

We both want children but having them is going to require medical intervention of some kind due the the amount of sex getting pregnant often calls for. Our sex life has turned into what feels like a repetitive cycle of duty sex with a few coke fueled nights of ""natural"" hook ups thrown in. We still aren't having enough sex to produce a child and it feels to me that sex has become a tool of manipulation he uses when I get too crazy to deal with. There are still rare moments when our connection is there, but he doesn't seem to see the difference either way. 

Back to the whole mental health/ not talking/ no fights thing. I know this isn't healthy for me to post all of this instead of bringing it up to him, but the chances of me getting through even a paragraph of this information without him tunnel visioning and seeing red over one detail is never going to happen. He picks and chooses what he wants to hear in a conversation and leaves the rest, which leaves me feeling wholly misunderstood because we always have different conversations. I have spent the last 6 years in a strange limbo of feeling loved, being silenced, and obligated to be grateful. Pot has gone a long way to aid in the complacency feeling, along with my avoidant personality traits that make me want to hide from confrontation, or any kind of trouble where I am perceived as the bad guy.  In this relationship parts of me have regressed to childhood because I am the bad guy and he reminds me subconsciously of my dad. As a child I lied pathologically because I couldn't cope with being in trouble. My fear of being in trouble or being the cause of someone else's pain is enough for me to have stayed unhappily in a relationship that I can't be honest in any more. I have done too much of the same thing I broke up with Dustin for. The worst realization and the most debilitating thing I've come to know is that Ronald loves me the way I loved Dustin and the fear of destroying someone else for my own happiness is killing me. I feel as though I fell in love with the idea of being in a relationship so hard, I wanted to be loved so badly, I didn't notice how Ron would make these compromises for the personality traits he didn't like in me instead of realizing we had such crazy differences we both saw and accepted the love we thought we deserved. I feel like we could have had a better chance at happiness on different paths. He deserves so much more than this conditional love I'm only half able to give. I wanted to be cared for so badly and to have someone to cuddle with I allowed part of my soul to be silenced, and shaved down so that we could fit together. Now I'm realizing that those parts grow back like hair, nails, or the horns on hell-boys head, you can't fight who you are forever. 

Ron and I have been married for almost 2 years now and our problems are still our problems, now I'm starting to get scared because he is a walking heart attack, he smokes, hes over weight, he drinks occasionally, and we eat out way too much. He has also never been active after work (lube shop), he never has energy after work to do anything except watch videos, smoke pot, and play video games. Any time I mention how much screen time he gets in a day, he gets defensive and angry and makes a big deal about it only being one video or one game, only problem there is its only one game if I say something, if I don't he might spend the entire evening staring at his phone. Not only that but we have actually started to have fights, and the sex has gotten so bad, like I said the vibrator is broken and we haven't found other ways that are as satisfying or as low effort for him (its still an effort with the vibrator, just not as much). We are 5 months into this whole Rona situation and I have been out of work for the last 2, which has given me an unprecedented amount of time to think (hence my dissertation). In the midst of this, and at one of my lowest points, Dustin came back. Again. Its been 7 years since we dated and we were only in each others lives for 10 months, how is it possible for his name to still give me chills. How is it that I still feel chemistry and love for him. I know how I can still be sexually attracted to him, as he is every thing I would check off on a list of boys traits/ style I consider to be ""my type"". Hes a country boy who has grown up a lot in the last 6 years, and guys this parts the worst, he had a perfect penis. It was long and smooth, straight and thick, I had no idea how lucky I was at the time, him being my first relationship I always had this idea that if this ends I'll just find something better now that I know the secrets of dating. Boy was I wrong. Dustin added me on IG (the only platform I didn't block him on) and though it made me shiver, I didn't follow him back or block him. A few days later he messaged me, this was on mothers day. At the time I had forgotten it was mothers day, and the conversation started with him asking me how we were doing in all this corona madness, and he wanted to let me know he was worried about me and that he cared for me. I found this touching but kept him at arms length, I didn't send him photos, I didn't hang on every message or give them special attention. I messaged him back when I thought to check the app, no more. Then I remembered that his mother had died and realized that he pry reached out to me for comfort because that's always been a hard day for him. I can't figure it out but talking to him this time feels so different, like hes grown up a bit and my mind is blown that he still feels like I'm the one that got away. I always thought having someone pining after you would feel good, I mostly just feel like I need to poop, all the damn time. My nerves have been bundled so tightly with the lack of sex and now the secrecy again, on top of me falling in love with my ex again over a daydream idea that maybe my life would be further along, or on a better, simpler happier path if I had recognized the red flags in my current situation that are starting to feel like boulders now. How could I have married someone else when I so clearly never stopped loving Dustin. I hate myself every day, and have the thought, iwannadie at least 20 times a day because I'm too cowardly to be honest with my husband, too greedy to tell Dustin to f\*\*k off and yet, I'm too scared to trust Dustin and so I'm here again, questioning all of my life choices. I guess after all that if your still here, kind reader, my question is am I doomed to always feel as though there is a better life some where else? Is my current relationship as fake as it seems here on paper? Where does someone go from here. We still don't have children so leaving would be relatively easy, but how do I live with myself? Especially if I manage to find happiness as I don't feel as though I deserve a soft spot to land on at this point. 

TL;DR: need help figuring out how I got trapped in a long term monogamous relationship that is starving me sexually, ex comes back into the picture and I'm questioning every choice I ever made."
3587,relationships,Help me out,"I [M/27] keep missing my ex [F/28] of two months and I really want her back to try and do the relationship better. But the thing is I was an asshole to her because of the way she broke up with me (through snapchat) and giving me two reasons that contradicted why she was breaking up with me. I feel like it was my fault, that I was a bit narcissistic but only the trait of loving too quickly. Got any advice on how to proceed, should I try to talk to her or just give up on her? 

TL;DR: just need advice on how to proceed with this dilemma. I really truly care about her and I want to tell her but I don't know how without losing her completely."
3588,relationships,insecure around friendships,"So basically I am REALLY insecure about my friendships. I moved around a lot as a kid, so maybe it has to do with that? I'm still in touch with a few of my friends from middle school and high school, though so I don't know if that's my biggest problem. My parents are immigrants and my mom often complains about how she doesn't have any friends her age, so maybe that's rubbing off on me? Also one of my best friends from high school ghosted me about 2 years after going to separate colleges but she ghosted another friend too so it's really just her being a bad person or wanting to move on.

Now, every time I reach out to an old friend and they take a while to text back, I panic and feel worthless until they respond. I also am really sensitive when making new friends and I think about whether we will be friends in the future like if they will be at my wedding etc. Why am I so insecure and sensitive about this??

If it helps, I have generalized anxiety disorder and mild OCD about certain things.

Also any advice on how to get over this?? Is this just a part of OCD and reassurance behaviors or something?

&#x200B;

TL;DR; insecure about friendships, how do i get over it?"
3589,relationships,Does your significant-other think you talk over them but in reality they talk over you?,"My (25f) boyfriend (33m) says I talk when he’s talking some of the time. But from my point of view he talks a lot (he’s a very passionate guy) and I wait for pauses (or lulls in the conversation) to insert a question or whatever... by the time I start talking he has already continued on talking about either that topic or something similar to it. 

It’s very frustrating. How do you guys handle someone who thinks you’re talking over them... but in reality you can’t seem to get a word in. 

Sidenote: this doesn’t happen often in our relationship. It just happened a little bit ago where he paused and I asked a question but he was talking again... so I asked him to repeat himself. He asked me “and why don’t you remember what I said?” Obviously because we were both talking at the same time. And then he pointed out that I seem to talk over him. 

tl;dr boyfriend thinks I talk over him, but I think it’s the other way around. How have you guys handled this kind of situation or someone who talks over you?"
3590,relationships,"She said she needs space, but still sees her future with me???","Hello everyone, I’m new here and never actually made a post. I’m a 24/m and she’s 24/f, we’ve been in together for 5 years.

About a month ago my gf and I had a argument and the next day, she told me that she needed some space. So I gave her space without bothering her for a month..

Fast-forward a month later, I text her and she said that “I’ve never left you, obv I still care about you”...

Unfortunately I broke down and pleaded to her tearfully and told her everything under the son because I realized how much I love her. I wasn’t perfect but I know for certain that I was very good to her.She was cold and distant. So I drove to her house the following day and ask her to come outside and I begged her again, and she said “obviously I still see you as the future father of our future children and my future husband.”

She told me that she had neglected herself so much and maybe we could start out fresh. Then when I left her place she texted me and said “I haven’t given up on us, and I don’t want to cause you any heartache or stress.” She also said she still has a lot of healing to do, her anxiety was killing her, and when I asked her why we couldn’t walk through it together, she said because she wouldn’t be able to give 100%.

I’m confused and would just like some advice please.


TDLR: We agreed to a break, a month later when I checked up on her she said we were broken up. Pleaded with her to 2 days, even drove to her house. She said she hasn’t given up on us, I’m still her future husband. I’m lost."
3591,relationships,I (23F) don’t want my boyfriend (25m) to invite one of his friends to the wedding and we can’t agree on what to do,"My boyfriend and I were discussing our future engagement and wedding (again). We ran into the same issue we have before, and it ended in an argument. He wants this friend to be a groomsman, or at the very least be a guest at the wedding. We’ve argued about it and seem to be at an impasse. Tl;dr at the bottom. 

Some background, my boyfriend has known this friend since high school. His friend is the older brother of a girl I went to school with. The girl and I don’t get along due to her generally arrogant, manipulative attitude and need to be better than everyone at everything. She manipulated her parents into thinking I’m a bad person, and they don’t like me either. The brother seems to be somewhat indifferent. He went behind my boyfriend’s back on something a few years ago and lied to his face for months before finally admitting to what he did. The friend ignores my existence when we hang out, apart from greeting me. My boyfriend admits he likes playing sports with this friend and talking only about superficial stuff, not about anything too personal or meaningful because he doesn’t trust him. 

My boyfriend wants to put this guy in the wedding party, or at the very least invite him as a guest at the wedding and he seems pretty firm about that. He believes he’d seem rude and would upset the friend by not inviting him, especially since their other friend (my boyfriend’s best friend) will be there. He thinks it will cause the friend to end their friendship. My boyfriend feels caught in an awkward spot between not upsetting the friend and not upsetting me. 

I really don’t want this friend to share in our wedding, and I don’t want him or his family in too much of my personal life. I understand that’s my boyfriend’s friend, but our wedding is a special occasion and I can’t see how you’d want to invite someone you don’t even trust. It would not make my day more special by having him there. I don’t trust the friend, and I don’t like being around him. I don’t want him to share in our special day, arguably one of the most important ones in a relationship. I feel stuck between being a controlling jerk who makes my boyfriend choose between me and his friend, or making my boyfriend happy but not being able to enjoy myself. 

Tl;dr: my boyfriend wants a longtime friend he doesn’t really trust to be a groomsman or guest at our wedding because he doesn’t want to upset the friend or potentially cause the friendship to end. I really don’t want the friend at the wedding at all because I don’t trust him, I don’t like being around him, and I don’t want him or his family in my personal life. 

Is there any way to compromise? Or will I have to give in and accept that this guy will be in our wedding?"
3592,relationships,Do I (23m) owe my two old roommates (23m) rent money for late notice?,"My lease with two friends ends on May 31st, and I told them I would not be re-signing on May 13th (2.5 weeks before).

They have since signed the lease (just them 2) and found a friend of theirs to take my spot, although he is not able to move in until July because of his current lease.

They have asked me to cover his rent for June. I don’t think this is fair and plan on negotiating

My rationale is: I don’t owe anything and it was their choice to sign a lease knowing I was not going to sign. I am already planning on moving out by May 31st so I will not need to have access to the property after that time, and so any money I give them would be a gift. Now here’s where it gets a little complicated. One of the roommates is a friend and I don’t want to leave on bad terms, and I do feel guilty that I didn’t give them a month’s heads up.


How much should I give them?

TLDR: the guy replacing me doesn’t want to pay for June rent, and I’ve been asked to cover it for him. What should I do?"
3593,relationships,"I (23m) don’t know if I love my (23) gf (3years) anymore, or if there is something wrong with me.","Sorry if tittle looks like click bait, but I’m really freaking out.

My relationship has their ups and downs, like every relationship, I think but for some reason I’m kind of out of it.

I was think about how I’m really uncomfortable when going up with her, for some reason I really don’t enjoy it, I don’t know why I always feel out of place, but I cant think of anything actually wrong in the relationship.

I thought in my ex gfs, I realized that I got bored in second year of every relationship I ever had, but the thing is, I think I’m happy but I don’t know if I’m happy cuz I’m with her or if I would be happy without her too. 

With most of them I wasn’t uncomfortable going out, but for some I got uncomfortable too at the second year, and I slowly stopped trying and doing things.

I daydream a lot of going to clubs and dancing, (we are Christians, but she is way more old school and has way more rules), I don’t drink anymore (not religious, just never liked it that much) but I miss dancing and even if she would go I don’t feel like I would enjoy with her, I feel like I really don’t want to trying things with her.

And I don’t know if maybe I had never actually love someone or if I just have never feel in the same place with someone.

I would definitely say, our first years was like a dream,  she is an amazing woman probably the best girlfriend I had, but I don’t know what is wrong with me, she get really sad when we are apart cuz she says I don’t miss her and I haven’t told her but I don’t do, I miss cuddles with her and that’s about it.

Stay inside orders make this significantly worse, everytime I call her is cause I know she needs it, but I’m fine without it, i don’t know if I should break up, I wish I could ask for time! But what if she don’t wait for me or gets hurts, asking for time is kind of selfish too, I don’t want to waste her time either.

TL;DR: I get bored in every relationship in the second year and I don’t know if is something wrong with me or if I should let it end, so I don’t waste her time."
3594,relationships,How can I [M/25] fix this ongoing issue of communication with my gf [F/24],"We start of strong most of the time but it tends to slip.  As for why I’m writing this, I’ll give you an example of today’s communication and In hopes reddit can help us understand each other’s feelings better.

Today my gf texted me a good morning and wanted to talk about how we shouldn’t limit ourselves to just one couples therapist and search for a few different ones which may specialize more for younger couples and their communication patterns.  Which of course I agreed.  

However, the conversation soon changed to things I’ve done and she’s unsure if her investment in me (dating me again after we’ve broken up) is worth it.  We’ve both done our fair share of faults in things we’ve said and done, but I can’t help but feel like I was being the center of the reason for all the downfalls.  Constantly bringing up things that did which gives her reason to have her doubts.  I have told her several times that I have acknowledged my faults in the relationship, apologized for my faults and behavior at times and have tried to show consistency in my words with my actions of being more there, physically, mentally, and emotionally.  It’s still very early to see this consistency as a trend, but the efforts are there.  

I was starting to feel down mid conversation as it was about me and my previous actions.  It was starting to sound like there was no room from improvement on my end.  She started asking me if everything is okay as she noticed I was being quieter and less involved in the conversation.  I told her basically what I said in the paragraph above.  

She assumes I’m taking the defense by not being as involved in the conversion now.  She now mimics my behavior by being short answered and is clearly upset for me being upset with how the conversation took a turn.  I validate her that it’s okay for her to have her doubts, but I don’t think it’s fair to throw me completely under for the downfall of the past break up as it takes two to tango.  She was also saying that just because we plan on going to therapy that things won’t miraculously work out.  Of which I also agree, (not all investments make money) but that doesn’t mean I can’t remain hopeful that we will develop tools to help our communication and interpretation of each other’s words.   

Ultimately, could I have handled the negativity better? What could I have said or done to improve this communication?

TL:DR - I try to stay positive through my gf’s doubtful thoughts of us getting back together, but I can’t but feel like she doesn’t leave room for improvement.

Edit: I just want to say that our arguments back before the breakup were mostly kitchen sink fights.  Since getting back together, I've tried to avoid statements like, ""you always did this"" or ""you do this.""  Since I know these are fighting words, I want to limit the aggression that can arise between us.  I do say though, ""i dont think you should have such a pessimistic view and look at how therapy could be a life changing tool for us."" I also dont want her to look through a narrow scope that I'm the only reason; But that she has also made comments that influenced my behavior at times.  And btw, our relationship has never been physically abusive.  And we've also never pressured the other person to something like have sex.  It's always been mutual."
3595,relationships,Should I [23F] bother reaching out to him [26M]?,"After a painful, unexpected breakup with the man I was dating in december, we were very low contact for months in late feb he resurfaced and expressed regret for having breaking up with me. He said things like the 12 weeks he spent dating me were better than his whole 2 year relationship. For context I have known him for 2.5 years, met just after he broke up with his gf, and due to many logistical problems we couldnt date. Then I moved close, 80 miles away vs 5000. He then broke up with me in december citing 80 mi was too much, though he had plenty of time to understand the distance.

When he contacted me again I got a high from it as I missed us being together. At this point he barely texts me. I am sad to admit that I have sent nudes to him and strip for him on cam, cuz I know he enjoys that.

I can see that it is a mistake and will never do it again. He had the whole weekend off and didnt message me and hasnt for a while. Should I bother reaching out? I feel resentful towards him.

**tl;dr**: Should I bother contacting him again? I hate to initiate."
3596,relationships,My [20s f] dad [60s m] is being banned from my mom's [60s f] funeral and I don't know what to do,"Unfortunately, my mother recently passed away. This was incredibly unexpected. She lived about 1000 miles from me, and in the same city as my uncle (her brother) so he just started taking care of everything (cremation, paperwork, moving furniture out of her apartment, etc). We're delaying the release of her ashes at the beach because of the current global situation (and we're not having an indoor ceremony at all).

&#x200B;

I have been told by my grandma that my dad is banned/not invited to the funeral and banned from staying in her or my uncle's home. My parents had divorced 4 or so years ago, and were married for over 20 years. Their divorce was complicated. When he divorced her, it was in the hopes she would ""hit rock bottom"" and stop abusing prescription medication, and then get back together in a couple years (also in part caused by stress from a child protective services investigation, it's a loooooong story). Being banned from the funeral would really upset him (He doesn't even really know that side of the family dislikes him). He does not currently know, and I will have to be the one to break the news. 

&#x200B;

My grandma has told me that my mom was very clear that she didn't want my father at the funeral. My mom never told me this, but I believe my grandma. She didn't specify if that was the only reason (I was trying to be gentle and not press her). From what I can guess, though, I think my grandma has the view that my dad was emotionally (and maybe financially?) abusive to my mom and it worsened my mother's mental state significantly. It's also possible she knows some things about their relationship I don't. It is apparent that his presence would really upset them, and I don't want them to feel even worse while they mourn.  

&#x200B;

I realize that so much of this relies on years of context and the opinions of each person involved have wildly varying perspectives. From my perspective, my dad seems to be narcissistic to some degree, and would often make mean comments at my mom growing up. I think my mom had borderline personality disorder (she was diagnosed bipolar 2 but her most recent psych thought it was a misdiagnosis) and she was abusing prescription meds, most notably oxys (whether to self medicate or get high, I don't know, I would guess the former). Both parents seemed to have anger issues to some degree. My mom would regularly be losing her mind screaming for hours (whether or not anyone was responding) when I was growing up. She would also regularly lay in bed for days at a time. My dad would call her a ""lazy piece of shit"" and tell her to ""get a job"" (she worked occasionally as a substitute teacher) and he wouldn't give her money to buy things (she wanted a new winter coat and he bought me the one she wanted). My mom would threaten to kill him by putting coumadin in his food, and she tried to mildly light him on fire (though she claims the blanket wasn't flammable). I'm trying to include as much detail as possible so you can best understand their relationship, to understand where I'm coming from. Ultimately, they both displayed abusive actions towards each other, but I couldn't tell you who the ""primary aggressor"" was, and I'm done trying to figure it out. 

&#x200B;

My dad would be helpful with logistics of getting to and from the funeral/my relatives' places if we were to drive (and in helping to move her personal effects). But I'm not sure he would be great at the emotional support end of things, to be honest. (He pesters me about finances, college, job prospects, etc and it all gives me bad anxiety).

&#x200B;

I don't even feel like I really have a say in who gets to go to the funeral or not because I am not planning it, and it seems like it is just something that has been decided. I'm not sure what I should do. Should I push back a bit against my extended family and try to get my dad to be able to attend the funeral (even if he would have to get a hotel or stay w/ his brother or something)? Or should I tell my dad that unfortunately he can't come to the funeral? How much weight does the wishes of the deceased hold when planning a funeral? What is the right and moral thing to do? I wish I didn't fucking have to deal with this. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR: My dad is being banned by my relatives from my mom's funeral. They were divorced and had a long rocky history of marriage. Should I go along with his banning or try to convince them to change their minds?"
3597,relationships,My Boyfriend (M27) of 6 Years Broke Up With Me (F26) Due to Lack of Sex. How Do I Try to Rekindle this Relationship Before It's Too Late?,"Disclaimer: I am using a throwaway account to help me stay anonymous from my main account. I previously posted in another subreddit and was recommended this one. I didn't get any sleep. I feel like complete shit right now. All I do is want to stay in bed and cry. I can't eat even though I'm hungry. I can't do anything without crying. I can't look at something without it reminding me of him. The only upside is that I cant work due to quarantine...so that is one less thing I have to worry about.

My boyfriend (M27) of 6 years broke up with me (F26) last night and said it was due to lack of sex. I don't understand what made him do this last night. We were watching movies, laughing, and having a good time and he just brings up this break up out of nowhere. He didnt even ask for sex today. I thought everything was smooth. 

He informed me he felt like has tried everything to solve our deadbedroom, told me I'm like a starfish in bed, and he no longer loves me. He packs his stuff and I'm begging him not to go. I told him I would do anything, change into the girl he deserves to have, be better, and asked for another chance but he just tells me no. He's now packed his stuff and is god knows where...his parents live out of state and he doesn't hangout with a lot of people.

He hasn't called or text me back despite my trying to reach out to him. Its really sad to think that someone you have spent so much of your life and built history with is now a complete stranger. The wedding and honeymoon we've talked about will never happen. The kids we dreamed of having will never exist. Missing his touch and presence and doing all the fun things we used to do will never happen again...

I don't know why I wasn't interested in sex. I used to have a high libido in my past relationships...it just became low after a year or so in this relationship. It's not that I don't find my boyfriend attractive, I've always thought he was the one of the best men I've ever been with. There wasn't any specific one thing. I just got comfortable in the relationship and my self esteem was super low. He called me beautiful everyday but I was never happy with my own looks. I realize now that me looking good for him should of been enough and I pissed it away. 

I would do anything to have him back. I would put forth all the effort to work on my libido. I would make a promise and actually work with him. He tried telling me so many times I just ignored it. I offer no excuses. I know it may come off as hysterical bonding, but I'm trying not to do that. There is something that just clicked that made me realize how important sex is in a relationship.

Please don't tell me it's too late. How do I have save this relationship? I really want things to work out and I cant imagine being with anyone else but him. I want to be the girl he deserves and make him happy. Please advice me on how I can save this relationship from a dreaded break up?

**TLDR:** My boyfriend broke up with me due to sex. I want to try try to save this relationship and show him that I can change so I can be the woman he deserves. Please advise on this?"
3598,relationships,Should I stay or should I go?,"So I (26f) have been with my spouse for 2.5 years (25m) and just recently had a baby with him and I have an older child from a previous relationship. Here’s my issue - he follows a lot of single very pretty localish women on Instagram and I’ve creeped the ones I can see and he’s always liking there pictures - some provocative some not ... and we’ve talked multiple times about how it makes me feel insecure in our relationship that these women can be attainable to him versus Instagram models etc. He’ll stop liking the pictures but goes back to it after a bit thinking I’m not paying attention and it bothers me so we basically go in circles with the conversations every few months. It makes me feel unattractive and I feel by his actions that he doesn’t want me, he says otherwise but doesn’t seem to do much to change my feelings on this for very long ... in the beginning he was very much about me and compliments and showing me affection and such.. now it’s just not happening unless I point it out. My confidence has tanked and I caved and went through his Facebook and saw he looked up a girl multiple times that’s a cam girl - said he looked her up because she was on the dirty ... I mean curiosity is fine but he looked her up a few times and well she’s pretty provocative with what she puts out there. I’m sick of having these conversations and wondering if an ultimatum or counselling would help? Or should I just give up and deal with it or walk away. I love this man with all my heart and we’ve built a life together and I’m tired of feeling like he gets to just throw it away. The other thing driving me nuts is that he looks single on both Instagram and Facebook... he doesn’t post anything about us. He’s posted maybe two pictures in the last three years (not of us) and says he just doesn’t use them like most people do .. seriously need advice if I’m being fed bullshit or if he’s being honest because my gut just won’t let this go anymore.

tl;dr: spouse won’t truly stop following other women or make it visible he’s with someone - should I stay and fight or just give up?"
3599,relationships,Potentially NSFW: My fiancé told me he's into guys and I don't know what to do,"My (27F) fiance (33M) and I have been together 5.5 years and have wedding plans locked in for later this year (coronavirus allowing that is). In the first 6 months of our relationship he disclosed that he enjoyed watching gay porn - this was a massive step for him and he claims he had never shared that with anyone. Fast forward another year or so and (TMI) but we started experimenting with anal play which he obviously enjoys and that is now a somewhat regular thing we do. We got very drunk on NYE just gone (so 5 years into relationship) and he opened up to me that he believes he is bi and has felt this way since he was a teenager but ignored it as he was ashamed. He reassured me that he loves me a lot and only sees a future with me. I asked if he wanted to explore his sexuality and meet up with guys, he stated it's something he has thought about but he wants ME involved? I offered a threesome with him and another guy but he wasn't keen on seeing me getting with someone else (which seems a little hypocritical). 

I've been thinking about it ever since and I honestly don't know what to do about this. I like to think I'm quite open minded when it comes to sexuality and I fully appreciate this is fluid - I think it's important for him to explore that side of his sexuality that he has repressed for so long. But what I don't know is how to go about this? I don't imagine it would be very comfortable for me to just sit there and watch him get with guys? I've thought about offering an open relationship but I don't think I'm really 100% okay with that and I feel like this could eat away at our otherwise really happy relationship. My other concern is that what if he's actually just gay but isn't quite ready to admit this to himself?

Besides this we are really happy, we don't fight, we have sex often, love spending time with each other, talk about kids in our near future, etc. Is there another way to support him through this? Am I missing the mark? Should I just leave? I feel like I can't talk to friends about this as I don't want to 'out' him, any genuine advice is appreciated! 

TL;DR: Fiance has opened up about being bi and I don't know how to support him through that but maintain our otherwise happy relationship."
3600,relationships,I (30f) have a hard time dealing with my brother (28M) and am wondering if once I move out I want to continue a relationship or not," Long story short is that I rent my brother's basement suite and he and his wife live upstairs. I have lived there for 4 years. At the beginning it was great. I had my own space downstairs and they would leave me alone for the most part but when I saw them in the laundry room or outside we would have a conversation.  I feel like over time my brother has become increasingly hostile towards me and I don't know why.

Some of the things he has done lately is when I see him in the common areas he will not acknowledge me  (no eye contact, no hello), every time I had a friend over (pre covid) I would get a text to keep it down even though we were just sitting on the couch talking, and he started doing renos upstairs without giving me a heads up (the sound proofing between floors is terrible and renos have been going on for weeks). I am planning on moving out soon and when I texted him asking him to set aside some time to talk, he didn't text me back and this was over a week ago.

My breaking point in all of this though was about a month ago, I was having really bad chest pains and I was told to go to the hospital because I might have a blood clot. Since my brother was home I went upstairs to ask him and he didn't even open the door when I knocked and was just like ""what do you need"" and I told him I had to go to the hospital. His response was ""let me think about it"". So I ended up having to wait for him for an hour (luckily everything at the hospital was ok)

I'm just at my wits end with trying to have a relationship with someone who treats me with such indifference and causes me such bad anxiety. It's just shitty too because this is my only sibling. I have tried talking to him in the past about how he treats me but he either doesn't text back to set up a face to face or is ""too busy"" to talk

TLDR: My brother has become increasingly difficult to deal with. Is the relationship salvageable once I move out?"
3601,askscience,AskScience Meta Thread: COVID-19 and reaching people in a time of uncertainty,"Hello everyone! We thought it was time for a meta post to connect with our community. We have two topics we'd like to cover today. Please grab a mug of tea and pull up a comfy chair so we can have a chat.

---

**COVID-19**

First, we wanted to talk about COVID-19. The mod team and all of our expert panelists have been working overtime to address as many of your questions as we possibly can. People are understandably scared, and we are grateful that you view us as a trusted source of information right now. We are doing everything we can to offer information that is timely and accurate. 

With that said, there are some limits to what we can do. There are a lot of unknowns surrounding this virus and the disease it causes. Our policy has always been to rely on peer-reviewed science wherever possible, and an emerging infectious disease obviously presents some major challenges. Many of the questions we receive have been excellent, but the answers to them simply aren't known at this time. As always, we will not speculate. 

We are also limiting the number of similar questions that appear on the subreddit. Our panelists are working hard to offer in-depth responses, so we are referring people to similar posts when applicable. 

To help, we have compiled a few /r/AskScience resources:

- [The COVID-19 FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/medicine/2019-ncov): This is part of our larger FAQ that has posts about a multitude of topics. We are doing our best to update this frequently.

- [COVID-19 megathread 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ewwmem/have_a_question_about_the_2019_novel_coronavirus/) and [COVID-19 megathread 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/etkdx1/coronavirus_megathread/): Lots of questions and answers in these threads.

- [New COVID-19 post flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/search?q=flair%3A%27covid-19%27&sort=top&restrict_sr=on): We've added a new flair category just for COVID-19. You can filter on this to view only posts related to this topic. We are currently re-categorizing past posts to add to this. 

- We will continue to bring you new megathreads and AMAs as we can.

Of course, all this comes with the caveat that this situation is changing rapidly. Your safety is of the utmost importance, and we'd like to remind you not to take medical advice from the internet. Rely on trusted sources like the WHO and CDC, check in with your local health department regularly, and please follow any advice you may receive from your own doctor.

---

**AskScience AMAs**

Second, we wanted to discuss our AMA series a bit. As you know, many schools have either cancelled classes or moved to online learning. This presents a unique set of challenges for students and teachers alike. Many of our expert panelists also teach, and they are working extremely hard to move their courses online very quickly.

We are putting out a call for increased AMAs, with the goal of giving as many students as possible the opportunity to interact directly with people who work in STEM fields. This goes for all disciplines, not just those related to COVID-19. We typically host scientists, but we have also had outstanding AMAs from science authors and journalists. 

As always, we plan only schedule one AMA per day, but we will be making an effort to host them more frequently. To aid in this process, we've [created a website for interested parties to use to contact us]( https://sites.google.com/view/askscienceamas/). 

We schedule AMAs well in advance, so don't hesitate to contact us now to set something up down the line. If you'd like to do an AMA with your research team, that's great, too (group AMAs are *awesome*).
If you're a student or science educator, please keep an eye on the calendar in the sidebar! As always, feel free to reach out to us via modmail with questions or comments.

To kick things off, we'd like to cordially invite to join us for an **AMA with author Richard Preston on March 17**. He is the author of a number of narrative nonfiction books, including *The Hot Zone*, *The Demon in the Freezer*, and *Crisis in the Red Zone*.

3603,askscience,"AskScience AMA Series: I'm Brian Greene, theoretical physicist, mathematician, and string theorist, and co-founder of the World Science Festival. AMA!","I'm Brian Greene, professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University and the Director of the university's Center of Theoretical Physics. I am also the co-founder of the [World Science Festival](https://www.worldsciencefestival.com/), an organization that creates novel, multimedia experience to bring science to general audiences.

My scientific research focuses on the search for Einstein's dream of a unified theory, which for decades has inspired me to work on string theory. For much of that time I have helped develop the possibility that the universe may have more than three dimensions of space. 

I'm also an author, having written four books for adults, *The Elegant Universe*, *The Fabric of the Cosmos*, *The Hidden Reality*, and just recently, *Until the End of Time*. *[The Elegant Universe](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/series/the-elegant-universe/)* and *[The Fabric of the Cosmos](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/series/the-fabric-of-the-cosmos/)* were both adapted into NOVA PBS mini-series, which I hosted, and a short story I wrote, *Icarus at the End of Time*, was adapted into a live performance with an original score by Philip Glass. Last May, my work for the stage *[Light Falls](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/series/the-fabric-of-the-cosmos/)*, which explores Einstein's discovery of the General Theory, was broadcast nationally on PBS.

These days, in addition to physics research, I'm working on a television adaptation of Until the End of Time as well as various science programs that the World Science Festival is producing.

I'm originally from New York and went to Stuyvesant High School, then studied physics at Harvard, graduating in 1984. After earning my doctorate at Magdalen College at the University of Oxford in 1987, I moved to Harvard as a postdoc, and then to Cornell as a junior faculty member. I have been professor mathematics and physics at Columbia University since 1996.

I'll be here at 11 a.m. ET (15 UT), AMA!

3604,askscience,"If the coronavirus is respiratory and you can't get it from eating infected food, why can you get it through your eyes?","I have read articles stating that there is no evidence of anyone getting COVID-19 via food. The reasoning I have seen medical experts give is that COVID-19 and its virus are respiratory, so you get it from breathing it in, and if you eat it, your digestive system is separate so you won't get infected. But why then would getting the virus on your hands and then touching your eyes infect you? With your nose and mouth, my assumption was that you could end up breathing it in somehow. But I don't understand why it getting in your eyes would give it to you. I haven't seen this specifically explained anywhere. Thank you!"
3605,askscience,Is there any amount of turbulence which could bring a plane down?,"I've heard plenty of times that this is not actually possible, but I'm wondering if it could theoretically happen.

And no, I'm not asking this because I have a fear of flying. I don't need to be reassured about anything."
3606,askscience,"If a mother bird couldn't find enough food, would she let all her babies starve, or favor one/some and only feed them?","Sort of a morbid question, I know. A friend had a nest of robins in their yard, and just found all the babies dead under the nest, and hypothesized that a lack of food could be the cause of death. I didn't think that was likely, but didn't want to bring it up or force the issue when my friend is quite sad about the dead baby birds. I figure that if the mama bird knew that she wasn't finding enough food, she would choose one of her babies to favor and feed with what she could find, to give the best chance of her genes surviving in the next generation. Is this true? Or would she feed them equally and let them all die? If it informs the answer, the mother is still alive. Thanks in advance!"
3607,askscience,Why is there so little neon in Earth's atmosphere?,"Neon is the 5th most common element in the universe, more so than argon. The molar mass is also 20, higher than water’s 18, so it probably doesn’t escape into space like helium does. Despite being so common, argon outnumbers neon 500:1 in the atmosphere. Why? Is it because Earth simply didn’t start with any and that the argon came from radioactive decay? Is that why there is so much Ar-40 in the atmosphere because we never had Ar-36 to begin with?"
3608,askscience,Do our bodies make antibodies with multiple paratope configurations for the same pathogen?,"The SARS-COV-2 virus has many different unique epitopes. When a person gets infected, does their body actually make antibodies with multiple different paratopes? 

In other words, does a body's antibody response actually consist of various antibodies with various differing paratopes binding to various different unique epitopes on a single pathogen? 

A single SARS-CoV-2 virus could be surrounded by antibodies, but they're actually binding at different epitope areas based on their various different paratope configurations, with some having a higher binding affinity than others?"
3609,askscience,Could previous exposure to other human coronaviruses prevent COVID-19 infection?,"I was reading this article [T cells found in COVID-19 patients ‘bode well’ for long-term immunity](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/t-cells-found-covid-19-patients-bode-well-long-term-immunity) which says

>The teams also asked whether people who haven’t been infected with SARS-CoV-2 also produce cells that combat it. Thiel and colleagues analyzed blood from 68 uninfected people and found that 34% hosted helper T cells that recognized SARS-CoV-2. The La Jolla team detected this crossreactivity in about half of stored blood samples collected between 2015 and 2018, well before the current pandemic began. The researchers think these cells were likely triggered by past infection with one of the four human coronaviruses that cause colds; proteins in these viruses resemble those of SARS-CoV-2.

Regarding previous exposure to human coronaviruses, [NL63](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_coronavirus_NL63) looks awfully similar to COVID-19 because they both attack via the ACE2 receptor. What kind of research would be needed to establish a link between NL63 exposure and COVID-19 immunity? If there is a link between NL63 (or another human coronaviruses) exposure and COVID-19 immunity, would intentionally exposing people to NL63 act like a natural vaccine to COVID-19?"

3611,askscience,Why doesn't the CDC provided Oligonucleotide Sequences provided for Covid-19 testing match any sub-sequences provided in the updated published Covid-19 genome (version 2)?,"I have been investigating the Covid-19 testing process and more specifically how the tests were created.

From my understanding, the CDC has published Oligonucleotide Sequences ([https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/rt-pcr-panel-primer-probes.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/rt-pcr-panel-primer-probes.html)) that should be used by US RT-PCR test creators to detect the presence of Covid-19. From my understanding, these published sequences are the signatures for detection of the virus.

In trying to understand how these sequences were created, I took the original published sequenced genome ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.2)) published in the ""Chinese Medical Journal"" and tried to find the provided CDC sequence as it is my assumption that the CDC published sequences should match the original covid-19 sequenced genome. I was able to successfully find the first provided forward primer ""GAC CCC AAA ATC AGC GAA AT""  matching the end of line number 28261.

However, the scientists have updated the genome with a new version on Jan 17, 2020 ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947)) and I am unable to find the sequence ""GAC CCC AAA ATC AGC GAA AT"" in this Covid-19 genome. I have also checked the reverse (CTG GGG TTT ...) without luck.

I would assume the entire point of picking good Oligonucleotide Sequences is they should stay static over all possible Covid-19 changes. The CDC clearly says it may change these sequences but they haven't. How is this possible to have a different published Covid-19 genome that the CDC's test doesn't detect? Isn't the fact the genome was updated problematic? Could the CDC test ""verified"" test not actually be effective as a result? Did the CDC do it's own large scale sequencing effort since the first sequence was collected from only 5 individuals."

3613,askscience,How fast does the humoral immune response occur (after becoming immune)?,"Hi! 

I was wondering about the speed of the humoral immune response... Once immunity towards a certain antigen is achieved following a first time infection, how fast is the body's response to reinfection? Does the body develop and maintain the memory cells for an extended period of time, with these continuously pumping out antibodies with the specific surface receptors just in case reinfection occurs, or is there an ""oh shit"" moment wherein the body has to look through its ""immunity catalogue"" to then produce the required antibodies? And finally, whichever the process is, when the known antigen re-enters the body, how fast does it take for the body to trigger and execute the immune response so as to eradicate antigen from the body?

Thanks!"
3614,askscience,How do Genes know when to Turn On and Off?,"Certain genes are known to turn on and off at certain ages, for example in lactose intolerant adult humans (and most other mammals) the genes for producing lactase turn off after childhood.

3636,askscience,How are those incredibly zoomed out photos of the universe with the 'You are here' tag taken?,"I've seen some videos where they repeatedly zoom out starting from Earth. It eventually gets to the observable universe and a tag points to somewhere in the photo saying ""You are here"".

How are we taking a photo of ourselves? Similiarly, how is a picture of the milky way taken if we are in it?"
3637,askscience,Is donated blood tested on cancer cells?,"I have read that cancer cells can travel through the bloodstream.

If so, is donated blood tested on cancer cells?"
3638,askscience,Can Viruses/Germs Move From One Physical Location to Another?,"Not sure if this is the right sub, but saw some tongs used for hotdogs at a gas station. Got me wondering, if someone used the tongs, and they had a virus, could the virus ""crawl"" to the tip of the tongs, essentially getting on the food the tongs are being used for?"
3639,askscience,"Why would a hotspot create a large igneous province in the middle of its lifespan, rather than the beginning?","My understanding (I should note that I'm not a geologist) is that large igneous provinces occur as a result of mantle plumes, and then a hotspot is left afterwards; if the plate moves, a chain of hotspot-associated volcanism is left from the igneous province to its current location.

But the Colombia River Basin Group in Washington and Oregon is in the middle of a hotspot chain, with its earliest activity having been dated about 40 million years before any flood basalt volcanism in this region.  Is there any explanation for flood basalts forming this late in the life of a hotspot?"
3640,askscience,Is there any study being done right now for us to know when an earthquake will happen?,"I know earthquakes can never be predicted like we can predict the happenings of a typhoon, but I might be sitting on an outdated information. It doesnt have to be exact, at least an estimated time works really well, and of course the general area"
3641,askscience,How true is “Everyone has a different fingerprint”?,
3642,askscience,Why does our metabolism slow down as we age?,
3643,askscience,Will I test positive after being fully recovered from COVID?,"This is not my field so I am not sure what means fully recovered exactly. The problem is that I believe I had COVID and didn't feel any symptoms because two friends of mine who live with me had fever and sore throat and we immediately isolated. We can't be sure it was covid so after a whole month we want to make a test, but would it test positive even after recovered?"
3644,askscience,"What causes a sunburn, and what does it do to your skin cells?",
3645,askscience,How do freezers work? Is it an endothermic reaction?,"So maybe I've got my info wrong, but I was taught in science class that cold doesn't actually give out cold particles, it's an endothermic reaction that takes heat particles in and thus feels cold. Which is really cool. 

So I told my mom, and we're both kind of confused about how freezers work. And cold days? Thanks."
3646,askscience,How does the air in cities/high-traffic areas affect the fruits of trees? Are fruits grown in such places safe to eat?,
3647,askscience,"Do animals that mate for life ever cheat on their ""spouse""?",
3648,askscience,What is the average for short-term memory sentence recall?,"I tend to underline the key points of the books I read, and immediately write them down in a notebook from memory. I struggle with sentences longer than 20 words. I always reread after writing to detect any possible mistake that I may have made, then I add corrections in red when needed. After I while, I can see that I have no corrections in sentences up to 21 words. But every single sentence with at least 30 words has something in red: a comma, an inverted order of terms, the use of a synonym instead of the original word...

How dumb am I compared to the average foe?

Thanks!"
3649,askscience,"Musical Instruments and Typing, Similarities in the brain?","I was recently thinking about how our brains process typing on a keyboard vs Musical Instruments.

Are there similarities in how our brains process the activities besides the motor function part of the brain?

When typing out a novel or playing a melody on the flute, both of them are art in a way, so I am curious if anyone has any thoughts or research articles on this."

3651,askscience,Covid-19 immunity?? Can we train our bodies through limited exposure?,What happens when one receives a low dosage (below threshold required for infection) of the virus? Could this train your body to be somewhat immune or does it cause a mild/asymptomatic illness?
3652,askscience,What are the deciding factors in the altitude that a plane flies?,"In these days of ever increasing economical efficiency, what are the main factors taken into consideration when determining the most fuel efficient altitude to fly?

Why is it 30,000 feet instead of 20,000... 10,000... or 5,000? Surely it takes a relatively large amount of fuel to get the plane 1,000 feet higher in the air. So why do they fly so high up?"
3653,askscience,Does gravity cause a concentration gradient im solutions?,For example: Is there more alcohol in the the top of my vodka bottle if i let it sit long enough?
3654,askscience,How do you account for a large numerical disparity between two groups when doing opinion polling?,"To preface: While this stems from the ongoing unpleasantness, this is not a political thread and I'm not seeking political feedback.

There was a [poll done recently](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/face-masks-poll-partisan-culture-war_n_5ec584fcc5b642a7d150e103) about public opinion re: wearing masks but someone pointed out that this paints a false picture in that  it makes it seem like there are two more or less equal groups on either side of the issue when that hasn't borne out with other research done specifically on that idea.

How does statistical analysis, and more specifically this sort of polling, take into account a large disparity in the actual number of pro/con respondents?

In terms of answer complexity, please assume that I'm functionally five years old when it comes to math. I'm mod of /r/dyscalculia for a reason."

The shadow on the wall looked equally dark for all! What gives?
3660,askscience,Do cats get joint problems as often as humans? Why or why not?,"I thought of this question while browsing /r/noodlebones.  Also, I've always been amazed by cat's ability to run and jump well into old age (by cat standards)."

3662,askscience,What are the effects of CBD on REM sleep?,"From what I know, THC has a negative effect on sleep cycles and kills REM sleep. Does CBD do the same?"
3663,askscience,If a planet spins faster does the altitude of its geostationary orbit drop?,And as a follow up question: would this make it easier or more difficult to build a space elevator assuming that the planets mass remains the same?
3664,askscience,Why does salt water have a higher heat capacity than distilled water?,"I always add a little bit of of salt to my boiling water in a pan to get the heat capacity up, but I was curious why aqueous ions can hold more energy than just a bunch of H2Os in equilibrium can."

3667,askscience,"The Doppler effect. Does it change a sound's pitch, or does it change the sound's speed?","If say a siren is passing by, and is changing in pitch (a two tone siren, or a oscillating siren sound) would the oscillation, or the frequency the two tones change at change also, or would it just be the perceived pitch?"
3668,askscience,How hot is the interstellar and intragalactic space in dense galaxy clusters?,It seems to me that the space within these galaxy clusters would be that much higher because of the energies involved. Could life as we know it exist there?
3669,askscience,How exactly do scientists fire certain wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation?,"For example, when we go to an X-ray, the instruments fires xray way length radiation into your body.

If you go to a mri, the machine fires of radio waves.

But how exactly do these machines do this? In our everyday lives, if we turn on the flashlight, we are mostly getting electromagnetic radiation of the visible light wavelength.

But how do scientists or machines shift that electromagnetic radiation to be mostly X-ray, or mostly radiowaves?"

3671,askscience,Why is it relatively easier to recall the sense of taste and smell compared to other senses?,
3672,askscience,Don't antibody tests need to detect multiple configurations of antibodies?,"I'm under the impression that multiple antibodies with different binding site structures can be made by different people for the same pathogen. Every piece of literature I read refer to ""the antibody"" for a certain pathogen like it's some kind of singular monolithic thing, where in reality I think antibodies for a certain pathogen are actually pluralistic things with a certain degree of variability? There is no ""antibody."" There is no ""the antibody"" for SARS-CoV-2.

SARS-CoV-2 for instance can have multiple unique areas on their protein structures in which multiple different antibodies can be generated, so one recovered patient can have slightly different antibodies compared to another recovered patient, but both of their antibodies will still bind to different unique areas of SARS-CoV-2.

There are even companies that have whittled down numerous different antibody candidates to a few that have especially high neutralizing abilities against SARS-COV-2, the point being that multiple different antibodies can bind to one pathogen.

So when people talk about an ""antibody test,"" what are they talking about, exactly? 

Does the test actually detect the presence of *multiple* different antibodies, all of which have demonstrated binding effects with the virus? 

Or do the tests only detect one specific configuration of antibody, and can miss other antibody configurations, resulting in a false negative (the patient actually had been infected and did produce antibodies, just not the ones that the test is specific for)."
3673,askscience,Is it possible to have an object whose surface area grows faster than its volume?,"I am familiar with the square-cube law, but all the examples I can find only discuss regular solids, I am wondering if it applies to all 3D objects."
3674,askscience,What anatomical features would be especially prevalent in something that was built for head-butting stuff?,"So I am working on a personal project of designing some cool fighting robots (non functional, just art) and I want to design one that is based around head-butting it’s enemies. What kind of features would something like this have? What would it look like? 

I’ve taken a look at rams, bulls, bisons and even the pachycephalosaurs but I feel like their design could be taken up a notch."
3675,askscience,"My dad wants to know: If Corona virus came from animals, why is vaccinating all humans the solution, and not vaccinating all animals?","It’s incredibly stupid, I know. Can someone smarter than me just destroy this argument."
3676,askscience,Do our ACE-2 receptors go through metamorphosis at any point throughout out lives?,"So it's known that sars-cov-2 attaches to the ace-2 receptors within our lungs, and it's also known it doesn't seem to effect children as strongly. Is this possibly due to children having lungs that are still developing meaning the virus can't as readily identify the host cell? Or is it more likely that the smaller lung surface area means that children would on average be getting a smaller viral load due to less available binding sites?  I understand no one really has any solid answers at the moment but any ideas would be appreciated"
3677,askscience,"If there is a pool suspended in the air by cables or bars or something, and someone jumps into the pool, would the cables and or bars be under any more stress?","Basically, do you really become ""weightless"" while in water?"
3678,askscience,How does a horse know it's a horse?,"This question occurred to me when introducing a new horse to one we've had for ages. As soon as they saw each other there was definite + immediate interest, and a lot of snorting, murmuring etc, which I took to be recognition that they were the same species. Horses don't react that way to cows for example. And I don't think it was smell - there was quite a strong cross wind that day.

So it seems that they recognised each other as horses by sight. Do they know that the animal they're looking at is the same as them? If so, how do they know that?

Thanks"
3679,askscience,Can human sweat transmit viral infections?,"My wife and I enjoy watching cooking shows and are sometimes grossed out by cooks dripping sweat in/on their stations. 
  Is our grossed out reaction unfounded?  Are we just overlooking that cooked food is cooked?
  Are viruses transmitted via sweat?"
3680,askscience,Are any of the human body's natural responses to bacterial infections also effective against viruses?,I'm talking mainly about antibodies on a serum level.
3681,askscience,"How did science become divided into chemistry, biology and physics?","I'm not sure if this is a question more suited for [r/AskHistory](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistory/), but I'll just try anyway haha. How did science become categorised into chemistry, biology and physics? Was it something that just came about organically, or did some scientific organisation in the past agree on this? Why this particular classification system?"
3682,askscience,Would it be possible for a blood test to identify an asymptomatic COVID carrier?,
3683,askscience,Does traveling above any given body’s escape velocity mean that you cannot enter into an orbit with that body?,"I hope my question makes sense. If say you wanted to orbit the Alpha Centauri system or one of the specific stars therein, but you arrive at a fraction of the speed of light, say .01c. This would be far higher than any relevant escape velocity for the system. Where I get hazy is wether or not that means you could fall into a stable orbit at that speed. My interpretation of escape velocity means that any trajectory must be parabolic and until your velocity is below the escape value you cannot orbit that body no matter how eccentric or far flung your intended orbit is. Am I wrong? Am I misunderstanding the concept of escape velocity?"
3684,askscience,Was there water on Mars when there were dinosaurs on earth?,
3685,askscience,How did the first transistor work?,"Specifically, most articles say they used a solid slab of n-type germanium as the semiconductor component. Some articles say that there was a thin layer of p-type germanium at the top, some articles say that the electrodes generated small areas of p-type germanium around them when current was passed. Which is it? It seems like an important difference."
3686,askscience,Do neurons or other cells generate biologically functional magnetic fields?,"Just learning about electromagnetism, and I’m curious whether anything is known about magnetic fields generated during action potentials. 
Do charged molecules interact/move with magnetic fields for functional purposes in our body?

Further, do any human cells use magnetic interactions to communicate? Do any other animals use magnetism to communicate? Is there a magnetic-gated channel perhaps, similar to a voltage-gated channel?

Thanks!"
3687,askscience,Death toll from 'herd immunity'?,"Hi, a lot of my friends are arguing 'herd immunity' as a sort of strategy for combating covid-19.  I generally respond that this will involve many times the number of deaths that have occurred already.  My rationale is quite simple: Covid-19 has a current 1.4% mortality rate (due mostly to old people and people with poor immune function), and 'herd immunity' involves at least 60% population immunity (likely higher to be more effective). That means that if we just let the disease continue to spread as it has, the final USA death count will be 330million x 60% x 1.4% = 2.8 million.  Even if we somehow could control who gets the virus to restrict it to the healthiest people, this would mean something like a 0.4% total mortality (lowest group-mortality by age seems to be around 0.2-0.3%, and let's assume it spreads a bit outside of that).  In this case, 330million x 60% x 0.4% = 800,000 dead.  Are these assumptions valid, or am I missing something major in my estimation?"

3689,askscience,"Regarding the swap of roles of space and time beyond the event horizon of a black hole, what happens with acceleration and velocity?",
3690,askscience,How are older people able to long term immunity to novel pathogens if the thymus atrophies at a young age?,"The thymus produces T-cells for your body but atrophies when you are young. If this is the case how do older people have any immature T-cells left specialize against a previously unrecognized pathogen, or more specially a new antigen."
3691,askscience,Why dont we feel gravity the way we feel other forces?,"We feel the force of the ground pushing up against our feet and a skydiver feels the air pushing on their body, but an astronaut in orbit doesnt feel anything even though gravity is acting on them. Why dont we feel a downward force pushing us towards the earth?


I am flaring this as physics but not sure if biology or human body flair is more appropriate/"
3692,askscience,What is the starchy part of a potato actually used for and is it alive?,"The key question I have is, specifically, whether the starchy interior (the vaguely white/manilla colored bit) is full of living cells performing a function or if it's just a collection of sustenance used by the actually living parts of the plant. In either case, how does a potato actually make use of the starchy substance?"
3693,askscience,Is it possible to create an antibody that can also be spread via human to human contact?,
3694,askscience,"What do psychiatrists aim for, when treating a patient?","As in, is there an equivalent of homeostasis for the mind?"
3695,askscience,Can COVID-19 spread through people breathing?,Let’s say someone has COVID-19. Can them simply breathing spread the virus to others?
3696,askscience,Why are green beans associated with botulism and not other fruits and vegetables?,
3697,askscience,"If we have a vaccin for Corona, can we continue to make a vaccin for the common cold versions of the Corona familie?",
3698,askscience,What is the electrical current actually doing in am antenna?,"From what I've read so far, an antenna is just a conductive piece of metal and radio waves induce an electric current in it which can be decoded into sound or images. But a piece of metal can't discriminate and is being bombarded by every radio and TV station and wifi signal and garage remote in the area right? So are the electrons just flying around chaotically? How can you make an actual electric current when the electrons are being pulled in every direction at once?"
3699,askscience,"What exactly would earthquakes of magnitudes 10, 10.5 or 11 do to the planet?","Are earthquakes of these magnitudes possible? If not, why and are we able to tell what magnitude the strongest possible quake on earth could have?"
3700,askscience,"Why aren't neutrinos ""supposed"" to travel away from us?","I read somewhere that neutrinos were observed leaving Earth instead of towards it, which could mean a parallel universe.

I mean, if neutrinos come to us from all directions and barely interacts with anything, shouldn't we see equal amounts of neutrinos looking as if it is coming towards and away from us?"

3702,Amd,"The ""Zen 3"" Architecture is Coming to AMD X470 and B450","As we head into our upcoming “Zen 3” architecture, there are considerable technical challenges that face a CPU socket as long-lived as AMD Socket AM4. For example, [we recently announced](https://community.amd.com/community/gaming/blog/2020/05/07/the-exciting-future-of-amd-socket-am4) that we would not support “Zen 3” on AMD 400 Series motherboards due to serious constraints in SPI ROM capacities in most of the AMD 400 Series motherboards. This is not the first time a technical hurdle has come up with Socket AM4 given the longevity of this socket, but it *is* the first time our enthusiasts have faced such a hurdle.

Over the past week, we closely reviewed your feedback on that news: we watched every video, read every comment and saw every Tweet. We hear that many of you hoped for a longer upgrade path. We hear your hope that AMD B450 and X470 chipsets would carry you into the “Zen 3” era. 

Our experience has been that large-scale BIOS upgrades can be difficult and confusing especially as processors come on and off the support lists.  As the community of Socket AM4 customers has grown over the past three years, our intention was to take a path forward that provides the safest upgrade experience for the largest number of users. However, we hear you loud and clear when you tell us you would like to see B450 or X470 boards extended to the next generation “Zen 3” products.

As the team weighed your feedback against the technical challenges we face, we decided to change course. As a result, we will enable an upgrade path for B450 and X470 customers that adds support for next-gen AMD Ryzen™ Processors with the “Zen 3” architecture. This decision is very fresh, but here is a first look at how the upgrade path is expected to work for customers of these motherboards. 

1) We will develop and enable our motherboard partners with the code to support “Zen 3”-based processors in select beta BIOSes for AMD B450 and X470 motherboards.

2) These optional BIOS updates will disable support for many existing AMD Ryzen™ Desktop Processor models to make the necessary ROM space available. 

3) The select beta BIOSes will enable a one-way upgrade path for AMD Ryzen Processors with “Zen 3,” coming later this year. Flashing back to an older BIOS version will not be supported.

4) To reduce the potential for confusion, our intent is to offer BIOS download only to verified customers of 400 Series motherboards who have purchased a new desktop processor with “Zen 3” inside. This will help us ensure that customers have a bootable processor on-hand after the BIOS flash, minimizing the risk a user could get caught in a no-boot situation.

5) Timing and availability of the BIOS updates will vary and may not immediately coincide with the availability of the first “Zen 3”-based processors. 

6) This is the final pathway AMD can enable for 400 Series motherboards to add new CPU support. CPU releases beyond “Zen 3” will require a newer motherboard.

7) AMD continues to recommend that customers choose an AMD 500 Series motherboard for the best performance and features with our new CPUs. 

There are still many details to iron out, but we’ve already started the necessary planning. As we get closer to the launch of this upgrade path, you should expect another blog just like this to provide the remaining details and a walkthrough of the specific process. 

At CES 2017, AMD made a commitment: we would [support AMD Socket AM4 until 2020](https://www.overclock3d.net/news/cpu_mainboard/amd_reaffirms_commitment_to_am4_socket_until_2020/1). We’ve spent the next three years working very hard to fulfill that promise across four architectures, plus pioneering use of new technologies like chiplets and PCIe® Gen 4. Thanks to your feedback, we are now set to bring “Zen 3” to the AMD 400 Series chipsets. We’re grateful for your passion and support of AMD’s products and technologies. 

We’ll talk again soon."

3712,Amd,"What's the purpose of the high ""idle"" voltages on Zen 2?","So I know that there has been a lot of talk in the past about how seeing voltage spikes up to 1.5 V in low load situations is perfectly normal on these CPUs, but one thing I couldn't find an answer to despite a fair amount of searching is...why does the CPU do that in the first place? What's the purpose of pumping such high voltage into it? It only seems to generate heat, but otherwise doesn't seem to serve much purpose. Surely I'm missing something?

I mean my 3600 can run AVX Short FFTs Prime 95 stable at around 1.25V at 4250 all core OC (which is still lower voltage than what FIT pumps into the CPU on full auto mode in this test at lower frequency). The temperature at ""idle"" (not a real idle, but browser and such running) is upper 40's with spikes to lower 50's. While gaming, I can be as low as 43-45C with that. Compared to that, if I leave everything on full auto with +50 Auto OC, the CPU gets to the same 4250 frequency, but with voltage spikes of up to 1.45 V and ""idle"" temps of high 50's, spiking to low 60's and sometimes even to low 70's for a few seconds. In gaming, I get identical performance and frequency again, but some 10C higher temps and voltage around 1.35V. The voltage does drop below 1 V on ""unused"" cores at times, but it does very little for the temperature.

So what's the point? I'm sure there must be a reason why it is designed this way? I would understand if the auto stuff put the temperature somewhat higher than what is needed, just to have a bit of ""stability headroom"" for the CPU...but why go 0.2 V higher for seemingly no reason except a temperature increase? What am I missing?

Thanks."

I'd like to create a list of Mainboards that will support Zen 3 to help people buying the right products for Zen 3.

I will update the OP as quickly as possible, when new info comes in. Work in progress, to compile a list over the next few weeks and months and keep everyone updated. Goal is to make x470/b450 users aware if they will be able to upgrade or if they have to buy a new mainboard.

Take everything with a grain of salt until we have confirmation.

3748,Amd,Fixed VRAM Overclock Issues with my Radeon VII," 

TL/DR: I got the VRAM to go from being stable at 1140 Mhz to 1180 Mhz by raising the voltage at the lowest frequency on the GPU tuning advanced control (808 Mhz) from 739 mV to 811 mV.

Hey guys! So I fixed a ""***sort of""*** issue (really it is a non-issue) I was having with my Radeon VII.

For some background, I work as a drafter for a construction contracting company (I use Autodesk AutoCAD). I use it at least 8 hours a day for just work, plus use my PC for gaming, and then using my PC for the folding@home at night. This is the [link to build](https://www.reddit.com/r/watercooling/comments/eolziy/first_custom_loop_radeon_vii_i73770k_overclocked/). Since posting this, I even upgraded the thermal pads from the EKWB thermal pads that came with the waterblock (1mm thick, 3.5 W/mK), to using the ***quite expensive*** Fujipoly Ultra Extreme XR-m thermal pads (1mm thick, 17 W/mK). It has been working like a champion since I bought it. I am running the Addrenalin 20.04.2 driver, and it has been working fine.

I have it overclocked. But I couldn't get the VRAM overclock beyond around 1140 mhz maximum, and it be stable. From what I hear, many people have posted getting memory frequencies at 1200 mhz. I thought I was just lost the silicone lottery on it, and was going to take the hit on the investment of the fancy thermal pads.

BUT, I just fixed it. Turns out that raising the voltage on the GPU tuner graph at the lowest frequency would make the memory overclock more stable.

I raised the voltage at 808 Mhz from 739 mV to 811 mV, and low and behold, it passed all my benchmarks with flying colors back-to-back at 1180 Mhz! I don't have any powerplay/morepower mods on my card. So I thought I would let you all know I could get these speeds easily.

&#x200B;

I then experimented with it a bit, and did a pretty big undervolt, 994 mV @ 1801 Ghz (stock max frequency), while keeping the VRAM at 1180 Mhz and the min at 811 mV. And low and behold, everything works flawlessly still! I am blown away!   


Just wanted to share this with you all. I felt super silly after discovering this, and decided to share the solution if anyone else was having issues.  


And after discussing this in another thread, yes, for this works with the Vega 64 to get better VRAM speeds."

It has been brought to my attention that AMD GPU drivers do not load files larger than 4 GB in GPUs that have more than 4 GB of memory. With the DAG file rapidly increasing and 4 GB GPUs being unable to mine ETH and ETC by the end of the year, I kindly request that someone looks for a fix on the drivers, so that our 8 GB GPUs aren't also useless by then.

Such thing was brought to my attention via the following video:

3781,Amd,RAM Subtimings Benchmarking ft. AC Odyssey,
3782,Amd,Is it really worth waiting for the 4000 series?,"My old laptop blew up last week and needs replacing. I know there's a lot of excitement about the new 4000 series but I'm really quite confused by how these stack up against the exiting chips - not least because some current laptops seem to have 3000 series processors, which I thought were meant for desktops?

Part of the trouble is that I want a model that will run low-end games. I'm not bothered about running CoD at 60FPS in 4K but I do enjoy strategy and platform games and some can push the graphics envelope a bit. As such, I'm quite tempted by the integrated GPUs in AMD chips in the hope they'll save me some cash on a dedicated graphics card.

I have no current plans to do anything else that will push the hardware - some photo editing, probably. The kids may want to do light video editing in the future, but nothing professional grade.

I'm in the UK and there are very few models with the new chips available. The only ones I can find on the market are ASUS gaming laptops which all either seem to have crap screens or be stupidly expensive. And fun as it might be to have all that gaming power, I don't really need it. I have no idea when there are going to be models from other manufacturers out, or how much they're going to be.

So: are these new 4000 series GPUs really going to be worth the inconvenience of waiting likely some weeks for a new laptop? Are they significantly better for my needs, in particular, the built-in GPU (and I understand they offer better power/heat management than existing units)? Or am I safe buying a rig with an existing 2000/3000 series chip and if so, which?"

3786,Amd,How do you check the stability of an overclocked Ryzen 3000 processor ?,"I have been trying to overclock my 3800x for a while now and I have been facing some problems so I decided to ask here.

I realized that the operating temperature has a huge impact on the overclock stability. This causes some problems on my overclocks. After doing an overclock and finding out that it is stable by testing with Prime95 for hours, I decide to change the fan curve on my AIO a bit and BOOM! The overclock isn't stable anymore. Another example is when I do an overclock in the winter, the overclock becomes unstable in Sommer. This wasn't the case with my Intel and 1st gen Ryzen cpus. Is there any way to reduce the effect of the temperature changes to the overclock stability ?

Another problem is the guaranteed stability. My overclock can sometimes run Prime95 for hours without a problem but it crashes in some games.  Does this mean that even Prime95 can't guarantee a stable overclock ? Even if the overclock doesn't cause any problems, can it corrupt the OS files overtime ?

Any help will be appreciated."

* At least four rear USB 3.1 ports on different controllers for my Oculus Rift. 

Desirable but not required would be at least a pair of RGB headers. I see a couple of the premium B450 boards had front USB-C, but it appears this will be more common with B550? Although I don't know what the price points will be.

1. How durable are the pins on the CPU? Thinking about it has given me a lot of anxiety, and I really don't want to bend them on accident. I'm used to the pins being on the board.

2. How are temps? Does it run hot? I'll be getting an AIO for it.

3. I might have to use the stock cooler for a bit, the wraith one. However, it's pretty scary because I've heard of cases where when people go to remove the wraith from the cpu, the cpu sticks to it or something and gets pulled out of the socket and destroys it. Is this common?

4. What motherboards are recommended for it? Since it seems there is a shortage of x570, I might have to get B450.

Anyway, from there I can find what seems like he has started a slander campaign against Copper Stallion, they then lied saying an Employee killed themselves, he then Slandered them on TV and now we're at the point where the internet is brigading the business?

I've checked all the news articles and the website http://www.justinmontney.com/ which covers the email exchange between the two parties, and from watching the news videos, reading the articles and emails, honestly, I feel like I've missed something where this has gone from ""Copper Stallion are dicks"" to ""Let's utterly destroy their business"""

They're interesting to watch, but there are a lot of things about these videos that don't add up. His first video was uploaded 9 months ago and he already has 2 million subscribers. The vids easily get millions of views. One has over 126 million. The video descriptions say that he is from ""The United State of America"" and are filled with multiple examples of broken English which lead me to believe he isn't actually from the US. From watching some of the videos, he appears to be all alone, living in the jungle in the buildings he's made. But the way it's edited makes me think he has multiple cameras set up so I have to wonder how he's charging all those batteries and how he's editing and uploading everything. Some of the videos have ""Millionaire"" in the title so is the implication that he himself is a millionaire just doing this for kicks?

I also have to question the viability of the things he's built. Because they're built below ground, meaning if it rains, they'll flood. And he even puts small pools in some of them. You can't expect stagnant water to last long. The descriptions say his goal is to build an underground city, but why? No one is living there. Is this just some art project? Is there even a Mr. Tfue? I feel like there's a lot being done here just to manipulate YouTube's algorithm. Tfue happens to already be the name of a very popular YouTuber and I feel like putting USA in the description is designed to push the video towards US to get more viewers. Putting millionaire in the title sounds like something that might get you more views as well."

3902,AmItheAsshole,Coronavirus Post Moratorium: Updated,"Hola, amigos. It's been a long time since I rapped at ya, but I been workin' for a living, taking what they're giving, all that.

We're relaxing the coronavirus moratorium a bit. The nature of corona related conflicts has changed along with the world. We've largely moved out of concerns over traveling, shopping, panic behaviors, etc. Lots of folks are now facing very tangible interpersonal conflicts as a result of being shut inside with others. We don't want to shutdown any and all conflict where COVID-19 is tangentially present, but rather continue the goal of minimizing the spread of misinformation.

So what's the new standard? Simply put,

#This ban now extends to posts that ask for a judgment relating to possible or potential exposure or risk thereof. Please report these posts.

I will reiterate: Follow your local authorities recommendations and policies for quarantine/lockdown/stay at home/shelter in place/social isolation.

I will provide some examples below, but read these with the understanding that ***this is not an exhaustive list and should not be pointed to in the event your post is removed.*** We simply cannot anticipate every way someone may ask about exposure and these examples are provided to help illustrate the line.

**Examples of approved posts:**

* Conflicts about priority access to internet/tech for school work, working from home, gaming/streaming, etc.

* Financial conflicts because you lost your job when everything closed

* You're butting heads with the people you live with as a result of being stuck together

* Changing household dynamics as a result of you suddenly having to work from home

**Examples of banned posts**

* Can your roommate still bring their SO/friends over?

* You yelled at someone for getting to close to you

* Your family is pissed you refuse to go to someone's birthday/graduation/fuck-it-it's-tuesday party

* Someone wants you to get a job and you don't want to risk exposure

* Posts that will lead to a debate about the merits of lockdown, when/if certain activities will be safe, who counts as an essential worker, and similar.

Please note, if debates or other discussions which lead to the spread of misinformation around COVID-19 occur, they will be removed from comment section.

We hope everyone is staying safe and sane in these times."
3903,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not letting anyone have anymore weddings on our property even though it’s tradition?,"
My husband and I own this beautiful property just outside the city where lots of couples like getting married. Over the past 30 years since we inherited from family we have hosted many weddings as well as other events as the the family member who owned it before us did. We live in the city for our jobs so we would go out there on the weekends for all the events.

Our plan was to continue doing this for another year then we would stop and both retire from our regular jobs and move onto the property.

Since my job decided to make my work entirely online we thought it would be the perfect time to move up our plans. My husband retired,  I’m going to continue working for another year and we’re going to move into the house on the property.

When the whole thing with the virus happened we had 8 wedded scheduled. We of course refunded everyone’s deposits and notified them that we would be closed for events. Since we’ve decided to go through with our plans I notified them and put on our Facebook page that our venue was not going to be reopening.

So far we have gotten a barrage of messages and posts on Facebook with a lot of people upset. 

For example one woman was very upset and talked about how her daughter was going to get married there this spring and how everyone in their family had gotten married there and how she was the only one that isn’t going to be able to get married there now.

A lot of people replied to her comment saying the same thing. That this property needs to stay open and that we are being selfish and ruining so many peoples traditions by keeping it closed.

We don’t want to keep it open. It’s just so much work for us. The property in question also isn’t very big, so having a wedding here twice a month (which is our average) would be very disruptive.

The place people get married is right outside the house and the house itself was used for the wedding and usually has people going in and out of it. We don’t want all these people in our house once we are moved in.

Update: You guys have definitely gotten my husband paranoid. Now he’s pricing security cameras and gate.

I spent the day double checking that everywhere online said we were closed. I also ended up deleting the Facebook page and our other social media accounts. All we have up now is the website up with the closed notice. 

I’m still getting some angry emails, but as soon as I get done talking with the people that want to buy the chairs and other wedding stuff we have I’m going to log off it.

My husband and I are considering having the place open just for some people who want to get portraits and other pictures taken, but that’s it. We’re just not up for any more big parties."
3904,AmItheAsshole,"AITA for telling a girl in my social circle that she's being a bully to the ""neckbeard"" in our group?","I'm (21M) quarantining with my university flatmates. 3 girls (all 20F) and 2 other guys (20M, 21M). 

One of the guys, we'll call Sam (21M) looks like the typical ""neckbeard"". He's largely overweight, wears anime T-Shirts, unkempt facial hair and has spots 

However, he only *looks* like the stereotype. He's not creepy or holier than thou. I've spent time with him and been to many parties with him, he just suffers from sometimes severe social anxiety and low self esteem. 

Well, he went back home for something and I was in the kitchen with the rest of the flatmates. 

One of the girls, we'll call Amy, immediately began roasting Sam by saying ""I'm so glad that ugly neckbeard is gone"" and how she doesn't have to look at him anymore. 

Honestly, I immediately felt disgusted. I don't like bullies. I don't care where they're from or how they look like. I was once treated like that and it isn't nice. 

I immediately snapped at Amy and said ""You're bullying him, and that's not cool"". She looked at me shocked I confronted her and things went quiet. 

Later my other male flatmate Henry said i was an asshole for interrupting Amy and that she was ""only joking around and having fun"". I told him tht he's complicit and should be ashamed. But I do wonder whether I was an AH for embarrassing her. AITA?

**INFO - Some asking whether he has had creepy behaviour to others. He is definitely NOT a creep, as other girls I know have said. I address this [HERE](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/gqwr5u/aita_for_telling_a_girl_in_my_social_circle_that/frvxhmq/?context=3).**"
3905,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not wanting to train my cat to use the litter box instead of the toilet because my boyfriend doesn’t like it?,"Basically my cat is trained to use the toilet bowl, I have two bathrooms in my flat and the cat uses the guest one, it’s always up and clean because the cat uses it and knows how to flush it (sometimes he forgets it), I clean it every day and my cat been doing it for the past 6 years. 

My boyfriend just moved in with me and he hates it, even if we have our own bathroom and barely uses the guest ones, he says it is disgusting and awful, last night we had a huge fight because the cat didn’t flush it’s poo and now my bf is saying that he is going to leave if I don’t litter box train my cat, but I see no point doing it since the toilet is much more hygienic. 

So AITA for not wanting to change my cats habits to make my boyfriend happy?

INFO/EDIT: Adopted senior cat, declawed with aversion of the box and burring his own waste. In the shelter in order to not use the box he would shit and pee on his own bed and sleep on it, thing that decreased his chances of getting adopted, indeed I adopted him because he was in the shelter for 4 years. Toilet training was the way (and only way) for him.

3906,AmItheAsshole,AITA for refusing to use “hiney cloth”?,"My wife of 6 years has become increasingly into hippie “natural” stuff. She no longer uses drugstore makeup and puts olive oil on her face every day for example (it’s strange, but I don’t really care.) everything has to be organic, fragrance free, etc. not really a big deal to me either way, as long as she still takes modern medicine seriously (like vaccinating our daughter.) so far it’s just been this difference that we live with. No biggie. 

Well lately she’s developed this idea that the asshole is like the mouth and anything that touches the asshole goes into the whole body. She suns her asshole on the roof deck (Imagine a person lying in the sun like a roast chicken) which is weird to me, but it’s a private roof and nobody can see her. She also believes any soap she uses on her vagina/butt is like swallowing soap so she’s been washing both parts with olive oil. I have to admit this is a bit of an issue for me because the olive oil appears to lock in odors in a grainy residue, but I’ve learned from previous situations not to say anything about this. 

Well, she’s taken it one step further by saying toilet paper is toxic and we need to start wiping with old cotton rags she calls “hiney cloths” which she keeps in a wicker basket by the toilet and washes every few days. I’m sorry but no. When I take a shit it takes at least 15 wipes to get a clear white piece of toilet paper, there’s no way I wouldn’t go through the entire Arsenal by 10 AM. Worse yet, she has made our daughter do this too, and 5 year olds are already not great at wiping themselves. Normally she’s fine with me doing my own thing but she’s become very adamant about the hiney cloth. 

To be clear, she washes the hiney cloth and is not asking me to. But I still really don’t want that much poop in our washing machine. 

She has really gotten intense about this because apparently our daughter keeps asking why I don’t use the hiney cloth and she has to use it. I finally snapped and said “ you can feed her all the organic food you want but I will never tell my kid their butthole is their mouth.” I’m sorry but I just won’t. 

She thinks I’m being unreasonable. After all the hiney cloth is just one thing. But come on. I can’t be crazy right?"
3907,AmItheAsshole,AITA for doing heavy workouts even though it makes my sister insecure?,"Hi reddit, got a situation on my hands. 

I'm (23M) not a big guy by any means. Hell, up until a few months ago, I certainly wasn't athletic. I'm about 6""2 and 165lbs, and was a pretty ""nerdy"" dude. Spent a lot of time on my Xbox, rarely doing much athletic work.

My sister (21F) on the other hand is very athletic. She's about 5""7 140lbs, involved in many sports. Always has been. She always took pride in her athletic ability. 

So once the l0ckdown happened 2 months ago (in UK), I decided to take up exercise, mainly due to curiosity and boredom. I wasn't concerned with bulking up, so I just ate my maintenance calories but ate high protein (so I'd stay the same weight but gain strength).

I went from being able to do pushups/pressups with 5kg on my back at the start of quarantine, to 2 months later (now) being able to do 7-8 reps of weighted pushups with 35kg on my back (while staying @165lb bodyweight). I can also do weighted pullups with 20kg attached to me, and weighted dips with 17kg.

This wasn't an issue until my sister last week walked in on one of my workouts and saw me doing weighted pushups. She asked me how much I was doing and I said there was 35kg in the backpack. She looked shocked and didn't believe me, so I showed her proof. 

Her reaction after was a bit confusing, because she asked me to stop doing these heavy workouts. I thought it may have been concern for my safety, but instead she said ""it makes me feel insecure"", I just laughed and thought she was playing some weird prank. 

Until my parents later suggested I should maybe stop and that my sister has had so much pride in her workouts, it makes her feel low that I'm doing workouts with much heavier weights than she is capable of (she can only do pushups with a 5kg weight, and struggles to do more). She struggled with depression for a long time so she is now saying that this triggers her feelings of low self esteem. 

I find it unfair because that's not my fault at all. I love the endorphins and feelings of strength I have after working out, so I don't want to just give it up because it makes her insecure. My parents agreed to back off, but my sister later said I'm an AH for not taking her feelings into account. AITA here??"
3908,AmItheAsshole,AITA for using my housemates' expensive clothes to clean up vomit (I hope it was vomit) they left all over my bathroom that they stole?,"I (20m) live in a house with 6 other people, 4m & 2f. We're 2nd year uni students in the UK. The place we live isn't university-owned.

I don't wanna get in to student housing but basically, you live on campus for the 1st year and then you have to move. I had 3 friends and we agreed to move in (3 guys) and then the others moved in with us after we found a house and we advertised spare rooms. The guy (M) and the girls (L and K) are troublemakers. M's dating L, and K is L's friend. They have always been their own group and have been rude in the past, but nothing major.

Our house has 4 bathrooms between us, so it's 2 to a bathroom and then 3 in one. K, L & M share a bathroom, and they don't clean it properly. Their rooms and bathroom is on the 3rd storey alone, so we don't go up there unless we need them, but their bathroom has stunk out the house before.

Because of 'things', everyone except K, L & M moved out of the house early. We've all returned last week to get our stuff, on different days to minimise contact. We intended to renew our lease next year, but the landlord wants to inspect the house before. Part of the returning home process was that we would all clean up our rooms and bathrooms so they would be ready for inspection when it happens.

When I entered the house (I was first to go) it was filthy - it smelled, trash everywhere, nasty. L had agreed that she'd clean the house in general, so I left it. When I went upstairs, I found my bathroom covered in what I hope was vomit. The smell was absoluetly diabolical. I shouted for 3 of them to explain, and they admitted that they'd been drunk and they were 'too drunk' to go up to the 3rd storey, so they just used my bathroom. They said the vomit was 2 days old. It smelled worse.

I demanded they clean it, but they refused, K and M saying that it's my bathroom and it's my responsibility - if I didn't want them using it I should have said (even though I have before) and L refused as she is cleaning the rest of the house. When the argument got heated they all just went upstairs locked their doors. So I went into the laundry closet, all my towels were covered in shit. The wash basket was outside the closet, so I grabbed something that I knew was M's and used it as a towel. I cleaned up the bathroom, it took 3 hours, and I got through a lot of their laundry (I know it was theirs, dw), and left it all in the basket at the bottom of their stairs. I shouted to them when I was leaving that I'd cleaned, hope their clothes weren't expensive. They all ran down and started screaming at me that a dirty bathroom is part of uni life and that what I did is 'illegal', I told them that they should have respected me and that I would be telling the others, as well as warning others from housing with them.

They've been blowing up our group chat trying to get people on side, but everybody is agreeing with me. I know it's immature, but AITA? They probably won't be able to get a close place for just 3 people."
3909,AmItheAsshole,AITA For not apologizing to my roommate after she walked in on me masturbating?,"I know the title sounds weird but it is pretty damn literal.

&#x200B;

I live together with 3 people(Me 23M, Kelly 21F, Jake 25M and Tina 26F) in a very large apartment(Very large for my area that is) We have a large kitchen that is connected to the living room and we each got an individual room with an individual bathroom. The rooms are all quite large, but mine and Tina's are the largest in the sense that there is enough space to have a large bed and your own little living room and little kitchen setup, so essentially they are apartments within the larger apartment which results in me and Tina not actually using the main Kitchen and living room all that much, meanwhile Jake and Kelly's rooms are reasonably large but nowhere near large enough to have their own kitchen and living room setup.

&#x200B;

The reason I explained all that is essentially to say that when home me and Tina spend most of our time in our individual rooms where as the other two roommates spend a lot more time using the shared areas as such when the others need to ask something or whatever they generally go to my room, if that makes sense.

&#x200B;

And that is where this happened, now I had a stressful day a while back with college bullshit, obviously I can't go see my girlfriend with everything going on and figured I'd have some me time, you know. Well while I was busy Kelly just bursts in to ask me where I put the mixer or some shit and well everything was on full display in full glory so to say. I pretty much just started laughing and told her to give me a moment and she started saying sorry and such. Now I am not particularly shy so I wasn't that bothered so I simply told her to knock next time as she should do regardless and I figured that was the end of it.

&#x200B;

Boy was I wrong, see Kelly and Jake recently started dating and Jake is a bit overprotective because he is really easily intimidated, you know the sort that sees a threat in every other male in the vicinity, he calls it protective, psychiatrists call it insecure. Nice guy in general though don't get me wrong.

&#x200B;

Well a few hours later I went to grab my controller from the living room and Jake starts asking me to sit down with him and Kelly as there is something he needs to discuss. Well to make a long story short, Apparently I need to apologize to Kelly for scaring her and to him for...I am still not understanding that one. I started laughing and told them both to get bent, he got angry and told me he was serious so I told them the entire situation was her fault.

&#x200B;

It has been a few days now and they both still want apologies, Obviously Tina started noticing they were acting weird towards me as well and asked me what happened. Well we both shared a good laugh and she had an even bigger laugh about them needing me to apologize.

&#x200B;

All in all I feel like they are acting absurdly but given how firm they are keeping to this apology crap Am I missing something here? Am I being the asshole essentially?"
3910,AmItheAsshole,AITA for throwing my partners 30-year old son out of my house after 6 years of refusing to pay rent?,"Good day, Redditors. I am a male (59) living with a lady (59) for 13 years. 6 years ago her youngest Son broke up with baby mama leaving him no where to go. Partner allowed him to move in for a couple of months to regroup. That was 6 years ago. To make matters worse, he took my closet leaving me with nowhere to put my clothes, which have been in a pile on my bedroom floor for 6 years because we have nowhere else to put them. This morning I was out and I passed the County Sheriffs office. I went in and had an eviction order processed on him to vacate before July 1. Partner had a fit and threatens to leave if I go through with this warrant. AITA? p.s. anybody who knows me would tell you I would give the shirt off my back to anyone that truly needed it. I have been pushed and pushed hard here. I pay for the house and everything in it. I’ve asked for little more than being allowed to live like a civilized person with a closet to hang my clothes in."
3911,AmItheAsshole,WIBTA if I refuse to share my inheritance with my relatives?,"Growing up I saw my grandfather twice, once at my grandmother's funeral and once at my high school graduation. I figured it was because we lived pretty far away, but in the back of my mind I guess I knew that he and my parents did not get along. He was a hard man. He grew up in the depression, and served in Korea so he was a product of that time.

I went to college in Boston and he lived a few hours away so I decided to call him up. He was pretty surprised I called but invited me out to the Vineyard for the weekend. Honestly he was kind of a dick, but I felt bad for him. He was all alone out there. I kept heading out there once every few months and for holidays. Overtime got used to me and he warmed up. The more stories he told me the more I guess understood why he was the way he was. When I graduated college I moved away but made sure to call him/visit when I could once a week and keep him company.

A few weeks ago he passed away. The other day I get a call from the executor of his estate, and find out he left everything to me. My grandfather started (and later sold) a company in the 60s that some of you are no doubt familiar with. Over 300 million in assets all to me. Not a dime for his children or other grandchildren. Now it may seem like an ideal situation, but this is causing a huge rift in my family with my aunt even threatening to contest the will.

I don't mean to make my family out to seem like some greedy money grubbers who abandoned him only to show up in time for the will. That is not the case. My grandfather did/said some things that are not great and I understand why they would not want to see him. They grew up in that house and I feel it may be unfair that they get nothing, so maybe the right thing to do split the money equally among my aunt, uncle, my mom and myself. On the other hand I did love the man, and I want to respect his wishes. I don't really need all the money, but I don't know if it is the right thing to go against his will."
3912,AmItheAsshole,AITA for eloping? I got married almost 3 and a half years ago!,"Me - (29M) my wife - Laura (26F) old friend - Shawn (31M)

So my wife and I actually got married in December 2016 so this situation is really fucking bizarre.

An old friend of mine recently got in touch with me after we lost contact many years ago and he saw that I’m married. I didn’t tell him this because we weren’t talking at the time and he got really offended that he wasn’t invited to my wedding.

I told him that there wasn’t a wedding. My wife and I were only engaged for 6 months and took our daughter who was 6 months old at that time and eloped. The only people there were us; our kid and our witnesses were the registry office people. We literally got married on our own terms as we didn’t want a huge reception.

Shawn has used the argument that we used to be really close and that I’m an AH for not considering him as a witness even though joke of my family or friends or Laura’s were there. He also said were assholes for just eloping meaning our marriage must be shit. He then brought my now 3 year old daughter into this and I swiftly blocked him. 

I’ve recently brought up this bizarre exchange with my mom and she thinks that Laura and I should have had a proper wedding instead of the registry office reception with our daughter that we wanted. A few others have agreed with her but Laura says they’re idiots for dictating what they think a “real wedding” is and her family and our friends are on our side.

Who’s the AH here?"
3913,AmItheAsshole,AITA for buying my own car?,"This is really old (7-8 years) but I'm still getting shit for it so might as well ask.

A few months before I got my driver's license my stepdad had a knee replacement, and couldn't drive for at least 6 more months, and even then he'd have to build up to driving longer distances.

My stepdad then said that he was thinking that when he recovered he'd ""treat himself"" by buying a new car, so he was looking to get rid of the old one. I'd saved up about 8 grand and he said he'd sell me his car for 2. It was pretty new, in good shape, and he'd bought it for \~40 grand a few years earlier, so it seemed like a great deal, but then he told me the catch. During his recovery from surgery until he got his new car, I would have to drive him everywhere. Any place, any time, with no warning needed, so he could hypothetically wake me up at 3am asking me to take him to get ice cream and if I refused then he could take the car back. So I'd be paying him 2 grand to be his chauffeur.

I said I'd think about it, because I did want a car and I'd still have been allowed to use it for myself, but I didn't want to be driving him around all the time. I went out and looked and found a car at a used car dealership for just over 5 grand.

Went back a few days later and bought it outright, drove it home, and mum and stepdad were furious. Mum had her own car, but her work was in the opposite direction to stepdad's, so they were relying on me taking my stepdad's offer for him to get around. I felt guilty so I did take him to work once but I was a new driver and he was loudly backseat driving, so I said I was never driving him again. They asked me to reconsider but I said it was my car so no.

My car lasted me about 7 years and somehow passed the MOT test every single year without fail. I got into an accident last year (not my fault) and it was totaled so I had to get rid of it but it was a good little car.

I live in a town where there's a lot of public transport, so I've not needed the car, but given current events I might minimise my time on public transport when lockdown is over. I mentioned on the phone to my mum the other day that I might be getting a new car and she reminded me of the whole thing with stepdad, ending the rant, and it was a rant, with ""and 7 years later we've not even gotten an apology"". So this is clearly something she's been holding onto for a while. We moved on after that but I'm still thinking about it. Part of me feels I should apologise and the other part feels I didn't do anything wrong.

AITA?

Info: my stepdad's knee took longer to heal than it was meant to. He wasn't back to driving until nearly a year after I got my car and even then he wasn't driving normally, it was building up to bigger distances. Took him about 6 months of building to drive himself to work (so around 18 months total).

Also I'm a girl.

And I did actually say to him when he made the suggestion ""so if you want to go for ice cream at 3am I have to do it?"" and he said ""considering I'm giving you a 40k car for 2k then yeah"" or something along those lines. It was 7-8 years ago so I can't remember it word for word."
3914,AmItheAsshole,"AITA for ignoring my step sister after she made her dad get rid of my birthday present cause it was ""unfair"" to what she got?","Me and my step sister's birthdays are within 4 days of each other but she is a year older than me, since we all moved in together when we were like 3 and 4 we have always shared a birthday which is on mine since its later.  She is at our place 2 weeks out of the month and every easter and christmas and spends summers and all the 3 day weekends at her mom's.  Her mom is a lot more well off than my mom and step dad so she has always gotten way better presents than me.   I don't mind that and I know my mom and step dad try hard to get me stuff too and my step sister doesn't really rub it in.

I do all my school work online now that they school is closed, and I've never had my own computer and have always used the family computer in the living room for all my work.  My birthday was a month ago and I asked for laptop so I could do my work in my room.  I honestly didn't expect one but for my birthday I got a lap top.

Like I said before me and my step sister share a birthday and since he spent a lot on the laptop (about 350) he gave my step sister a card with money that was about 150.  She wasn't pleased with her gift at all, my step sister complained for a full week that it was unfair and then told her dad that she would go live full time with her mom if I don't make it right.  He then got rid of my lap top and gave me the same amount of money which was 150 as my sister and said I can save up and buy my own laptop.

I have been really really mad at my step sister and step dad for this bullshit, she practically manipulated him into getting rid of my birthday present cause god forbid she doesn't get even more fucking spoiled.  After that I have been flat out done with her shit, I ignore her as much as possible.  If she wants to do something with me I am always too busy, if she needs help with something well I'm doing homework or something else I can't.

Recently she wanted help with her chores, cause it was her turn to scrub the toilets and she always tries to pawn it off on me.  I told her to just do it and refused to help her, she kept getting more and more angry at me cause I was ignoring her and telling her to just do it.  She called me a dick and left my room crying, my mom came into my room to ask why she was crying.  When I told her my side of the story she got really upset with me and took away my phone for making her cry and forced me to help her.  My mom also told me to get over not getting the laptop and to stop being so mean to my ""sister"" cause I'm acting like a brat.

Am I really the asshole here?????????"
3915,AmItheAsshole,AITA for being upset I got my art too fast?,"The other day I commissioned an artist to draw my character. I paid $60 for the full body shaded which is a bit pricy (for me) but I assumed maybe this artist takes a long time like 6-7 hours which is why they price it like that, so I understood why. They sent my a sketch not long after I paid and I approved it expecting to wait a while for the finished art. Well what ended up happening is that they sent me the finished artwork early in the next day and I was like that was fast?? The artist said they work quick and plus I got in early on their queue. Out of curiosity I asked them how long it actually took them for the drawing and they said just under two hours..... I know what you’d may be thinking that I should be happy I got the fast service but hear me out. I felt a little bit scammed because I paid $60 only because I thought this artist probably takes a lot of time, so it is worth it to pay a high price for it. But they didn’t even draw for a full two hours... I asked the artist if I could have a partial refund maybe because it clearly did not take that long. They told me straight up no and seemed kinda annoyed with me. Idk I just feel like the price wasn’t justified. I talked to my friends and like half of them said they understood and the other half said It was a dick move even just for asking. But to be fair the ones that said it was a dick move were also artists so they are biased. AITA?"
3916,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not wanting to name my unborn daughter after my husbands high school girlfriend?,"My husband (35) and I (31) are about to be first-time-parents as I’m currently 35 weeks pregnant. We found out it was a girl and my husband suggested the name “Tiffany.” I immediately fell in love with the name! I asked him where he got it from and he told me that he heard it while watching a movie and it stuck with him. I didn’t think much of it. We decided that we both loved the name and that it was going to be our little girls name! 

However, a few days ago, my SIL and I were talking (on FT) and we got onto the topic of the name. She mentioned how surprised she was that I agreed to that name because she’d never want to name her child after her husbands high school girlfriend. I was really confused at first and asked her what the heck she meant. She told me that my husband dated a girl named Tiffany from 10th grade until they were juniors in college. While I knew my husband had a long relationship in high school and college, I never knew the girls name. 

My SIL could tell how upset I was and assumed that my husband told me where he got the name from. I told her that he told me that he heard it from a movie and he never mentioned it was his ex-girlfriends name. She apologized and told me that she didn’t mean to upset me. I wasn’t upset with her, though. I was and still am so angry at my husband.

After hanging up, I confronted my husband and asked him if what his sister said is true. He tried to blow it off at first but eventually admitted that it’s true. We argued back and forth for awhile before I told him that I would NOT name my daughter after his ex-girlfriend and I refused to use the name “Tiffany” anymore. 

He tried to convince me that it wasn’t a big deal but IT IS to me because 1) he lied to me about where the name came from, 2) i don’t want to look at my daughter every day and remember that she’s named after my husbands ex-girlfriend and 3) it makes me feel like he still loves her... as far as I know, they’re not in contact and haven’t been since they broke up. 

He told me that I was overreacting, acting like a child and that I can’t change my mind now since I’m due in 5 weeks. I feel hurt and betrayed.

AITA for not wanting to name my daughter after my husbands ex-girlfriend?

Edit: after I finally got him to admit the truth, I asked him why he wanted to use that name in the first place and he told me because he thought it was pretty and that his ex-girlfriend was such a good person that he wanted to name our daughter after her but thought that I wouldn’t agree to it (which I don’t!), so he told me that he heard it from a movie instead of being honest."
3917,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my mom I'd move in with my dad if she charged me rent?,"Lemme make it clear I'm not some 24 yr old college dropout with no job or plan for the future. I just finished high school and I'm not even 18 yet. I have plans to start college in the fall and move out once my freshmen year is done if it isn't all messed up by the recent world drama.

This all started when my mom came into my room complaining about the dirty dishes; a few water bottles and a bowl that originally had ice cream that I'd finished less than 5 minutes previously. It was sitting on my bed, and I'd planned to wash it when I got up next.

The conversation suddenly turned to how this was her house and by proxy my room was technically hers along with everything in it, so I was required to take care of it or I would and I quote ""suffer the consequences"" she then proceeded to yell at me saying I'm about to be an adult and she was going to start charging me rent.

Note. That I don't have a job, and any job I've tried to get she has shut down. I HAD a job with my dad at a wing joint, I was going to my first day when she came home and threw a hissy fit about it because she thought it was some kind of power grab from my dad. When I literally just needed a job for gas money. So long story short I don't have a job and I can't get a job because she'll veto it and say no

So I have no clue how I would pay for this aforementioned rent. Which apparently in the words of my brother would be $200 a month because she did this with him previously before he moved out.

I thought about deflecting and saying I would clean it up but I decided I was done with her shit so I flat out told her ""I don't have to live here. I can easily go live with dad right now.""

Now suddenly I'm the asshole, and how could I do this to 'my poor innocent mother' when all she's done is 'support me'. When she was the one who started it in the first place.

So am I the asshole?

Tldr: My mom threatened to make me pay rent when she won't let me get a job, so I told her I would just move in with my dad. AITA?

Edit: I wanna make it clear that I will only be moving in with my dad if my mom STARTS to charge me rent. I am not going to pay to live with my mom, if I wanted to pay to live somewhere I'd live by myself. However she hasn't yet, so I'm still fine.

The job problem basically disappears once I turn 18, because she can't keep me from going anywhere. I mentioned it because I would have to start saving right now if she where to charge me $200 monthly rent the moment I turned that age."
3918,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling a woman to control her children at the dog park?,"Obligatory I’m on mobile, so apologies for formatting 
Where I (23f) live there is a massive off leash dog park with a large trail system. It is constantly packed, especially since it’s reopening with mandatory masks and social distancing. I go everyday with my 3 dogs. 

The other day, there was a woman there with her two children, around ages 3 and 6 from what I could tell. These kids were running around, screaming, going up to random dogs and trying to pet them without asking the owners etc. basically just being loud unruly children. 

Personally, one of my dogs does not like children, and it is pretty common for some dogs to not like children. Some dogs won’t even be adopted out to families with young kids because of this. Now, my dog isn’t aggressive towards them, but he will bark at them when approached quickly. My dog did not have a problem with these kids, he just ignored them, but I was worried the kids behavior would result in a bite from another dog who doesn’t like being grabbed by kids. At this dog park, it is recommended on the rules board to not bring young children, and if you do, to have them controlled. Frankly, it’s just a safety issue. 

After watching the 6 year old go up to the 5th dog in a row and try to grab its tail to pet it, I went up to the mother. I said something along the lines of “hey there, could you try controlling your kids a little more? Not every dog likes children and it’s a safety issue for them to be running around, screaming, and approaching dogs they don’t know without the owners permission”. 

This lady BLEW UP at me. She said something like “how dare you tell me how to parent my children, they’ve been fine every time we come here, this park is for everyone and I should be allowed to bring my kids to exercise my dog etc.” 

I responded that while this park is for everyone, it is first and foremost for the dogs. If she wanted to let her kids run around and scream she could go to other parks and keep her dog on leash. It only takes one dog for the kids not to be fine every time they come here. Every dog has a different history, and it’s literally on the rules board to control your kids. 
She continued to yell at me and accused me of “gatekeeping the dog park” (???) and I just walked away. 

My mom was with me and she thought I was kind of an AH for going up to the woman, and that I should’ve just let sleeping dogs lie (lol). To me it’s a safety issue, and I would hate for the kids to get bitten and for an owner to feel guilt over their dog biting in reaction to being grabbed by a strange child! But now I’m wondering, am I the asshole and was I “gatekeeping the dog park”?

Edit to add: my dog *is not* aggressive towards children, otherwise I wouldn’t bring him to the park because I’m not irresponsible. He will only bark at them if they approach him quickly as a stay away bark. He’s also only 10lbs so he just barks and then goes on his merry way. 

It‘a true I could’ve gone to another part of the park, and I did, but I wasn’t talking to her specifically for *my* dog, I wanted to bring it up for the sake of her children and other dog owners who her kids were clearly annoying and inconveniencing"
3919,AmItheAsshole,AITA for wanting my child’s natural hair color back,"I have no issue with crazy hair colors and even approved my daughters hair to be colored once for her birthday at three years old. However, that color was chosen specifically so it would wash out within a few days. My ex and his girlfriend keep coloring my five year old’s hair with Overtone and every time she comes back home to me she has a new hair color (our schedule is week on/week off). They haven’t been telling me they’re going to color her hair and I’ve asked many times if they could do a less permanent option because her hair is very delicate. Yesterday she came back to me with the most splotchy hair color imaginable and I finally looked her father in the eyes and demanded that he stop doing this. He doesn’t see the issue because “she asked his girlfriend to do it so they did”. AITA for wanting them to wait until she’s older to start making these decisions and use wash out colors for now instead?"
3920,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my girlfriend she can move in with me but not her cat?,"My girlfriend (Anna) and her family adore cats. They have 5 cats. She knows I don't like cats but it's not a problem.

The problem began when we were talking about moving in together after the pandemic is over or at least under better control. She lives with her parents right now and I have my own appartment but I moved in with my parents again due to the lockdown and we miss eachother.

My girlfriend wants to move into my appartment because I got really lucky and pay very cheap rent for a pretty big and nice place, and it's close to the university she goes to.
At first I told her that's great and maybe she can even move in this summer. She got really excited and we have since been daydreaming about life together

Then she told me how excited she is to bring her cat with her. I was taken aback, because this was never mentioned before. I don't want the cat in my appartment, not due to my dislike for cats, but bc I too have pets. 

I have three gerbils.
They are 1 year old and can live up to 5 years. I love those little guys with all my heart.
Right now they are staying at my parents house but when I move out they are coming with me. My mother can't stand rodents and I am happy she even let me bring them.

I told Anna that I don't like the idea of her cat living in the same place as my gerbils. I fear the cat is going to try to break in and gerbils are really delicate and could die from a heart attack. I know that their cats hunt and kill mice so I feel like this is a real concern. I can't put my gerbils in another room, their terrarium is huge and really only fits in my hallway and if I were to lock the hallway the cat could only stay in one room which I think is cruel to her.

Anna immediately suggested to get rid of the gerbils and let her cat stay, since it's a much smarter and according to her more important animal and compared my gerbils to goldfish who don't know what's going on anyways.
I understand her being disappointed because she had been so excited and I was too, but I can't give away my gerbils. We have bonded and so many people treat smaller animals badly on accident due to ignorance. 

I asked her why she can't let her cat at her parents house, it's in the same city and her parents love cats. This angered her and she called me selfish and cruel, because moving to my place would make her life easier but I'm forcing her to choose between me and her cat. And that I couldn't understand the bond between her and her cat because my pets are dumb rats. I was upset and told her that she is still welcome to move in if she wants but her cat won't move in at least until my gerbils pass away.

Everyone I know is telling me that I am an asshole for prioritizing small animals over my girlfriend and getting her hopes up that she could move in with me and then crushing them because I won't let her cat move in as well.


AITA for not wanting her cat at my place?"
3921,AmItheAsshole,AITA for choosing the wishes of my husband's ex over his.,"My husband has a daughter who is 6 years old.  We have been married for the last 3 years.  His daughter and I have an okay relationship.  His ex-wife and I are civil.  She really isn't difficult to deal with.

Her and my husband usually co-parent well together.  They are having a disagreement over SD6's hair.  It is long (about 2 inches past her shoulders).  She has thick, beautiful hair.  The problem is that it knots easily.  My husband hates brushing it after baths. He recently told his ex that he wants to cut it off (up to SD's chin).  She told him that she didn't want too, as she loves SD's hair.  Also, she said that her and SD have a ritual every night where she brushes and blow dries it.   
To be honest, his ex takes great care of SD's hair.  Anytime she brings her here or we see them out, SD's hair is always well groomed and clean. 

SD is the ex's only child.  We have 2 more children which makes bed time a little more hectic.  We always brush her hair but not as much as the ex does.  My husband thinks we should just cut it on our time and his ex will get over it.  I used to be a stylist so I do know how to cut hair.  My husband has been pressuring me to cut it.  I told him no, as I think it would cause problems with his ex.  Plus, when I asked SD about it, she didn't seem excited by the idea of cutting her hair.

I think this is a hot button issue and do not want to cause unnecessary drama with the ex.  My husband keeps pushing the issue and told me that my loyalties are in the wrong place.  I guess I am curious if others thing I am wrong for standing my ground.


Edited to add:  some people have asked why I don't just do her hair.  I do try and take care of it when I am home.  I work in the evenings so I am often not here for bath time.  I have tried to teach my husband easier ways but he just doesn't seem to listen.  I will work with her more to comb it out herself."
3922,AmItheAsshole,AITA for snapping at my MIL and saying she’s pushing me out of my child’s life?,"My wife and I have been married for 3 years, together for 5. She is currently 20 weeks pregnant with our first child and we have been excited.

My MIL and wife have been always been close, MIL raised my wife as a single mom. MIL was also raised by a single mom. MIL actually didn’t tell my wife’s dad that she existed and to this day, he doesn’t know. My wife has no interest in knowing her dad so she says it’s just not a huge deal. I respect her wishes, but it has lead to issues with the pregnancy. MIL and I had a decent relationship until my wife got pregnant. Even before she got pregnant, MIL would always say, “When (wife) gets pregnant, if you leave, I will be there for her.” And since we told her, it’s been a reoccurring theme. It has been made clear by MIL if I can’t take it  and leave her daughter, she will take my place and parent my child. I have no plans on leaving my wife or my child. 

And really, the whole thing has driven me crazy. My wife has said “I know you’re not leaving” but she says her mom feels that they know best with pregnancy and child rearing. I am worried about being pushed out of this child’s life and that it’s a wish of MIL that I will just up and leave, so she can swoop in and be the child’s dad. I have told MIL I’ll never leave but she says “you don’t know how hard it’ll be”. 

Recently, we were on Zoom and MIL said something to the effect of her being the dad if I left. I told her no, I’m not and she needs to cut it out. She said, I won’t get how hard it is until the baby’s born, etc, etc. I said “yes and that’s just what you want, for your daughter to be abandoned and sad, that’s pretty sadistic.” This offended MIL and apparently my wife too. Apparently I don’t understand that MIL has abandonment issues because her dad left her. I said I sympathize but she cut one man out of knowing his kid (my wife’s dad and her) and now is doing the same. They are painting me as the devil here.

Am I being the asshole?"
3923,AmItheAsshole,AITA for buying a nice cooking set for my daughter but not my son?,"This will be a throwaway, I’m an older person and I’m curious about what younger people will think about this situation. 

I have two children, a girl and a boy. My daughter loves to cook, has been cooking since she was about three years old. As she got older, she even helped my wife and I out by making dinner a couple of times a week. It’s a passion of hers. 

When daughter was gearing up to get an apartment, my wife and I took the time to get her some lovely Le Creuset pans. My wife got one for each color of the rainbow. She cried when we gifted them to her, they are her pride and joy. We used to have dinner at her house once a week, the pots and pans look brand new, they will last her forever. 

My son never cared to learn how to cook. My wife tried endlessly to try to help him learn how to make basic meals, but he was never interested. I’m pretty sure that he would burn ice. He has never taken an interest in cooking.

My son is currently moving out into his first apartment. As we are helping him move, my wife and I decided to help him get a sofa and a bigger TV for his living room (both he and his roommates have small TVs). While this costed less than the cookware, it was something they needed. We got him a couple of pots and pans from target to take with him. 

As we were moving him in, he asked where his nice pans were. My wife and I were both confused. He started getting upset, recalling the nice set we got his sister when she moved out. My wife and I laughed about it. We asked him what he would need them for if dominoes was going to be doing most of his cooking (thinking he was playing around about them). He actually got very upset by this and told us that we were playing favorites. 

We pointed what we did buy him, but it was no conciliation. We ended up leaving his apartment, and he is actually not speaking to us! We didn’t think that this was a big deal, but his behavior is making us question that. Is there something that we are missing here young people of reddit? Are my wife and I assholes for not buying my son expensive cookware?"
3924,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not wanting to support my parents financially?,"I should give a little backstory here: growing up, my parents were extremely wealthy. I watched my dad blow his money on a mansion, sports cars, and unnecessary purchases he made to show off his wealth. He owned a very successful and stable business, but decided to gamble it all away when he sold the company to start a new one that completely failed. We lost everything. 
We moved out of the mansion and for the rest of my childhood and adolescence, we were so poor that we barely had money for food. I got made fun of in school for having old clothes that didn't fit me. My parents still would have cleaning people come over and clean our house and I would watch them pay them in cash as I sat there hungry. They did everything they could to keep up with their appearances while neglecting my needs. 
Now on to today, their financial situation has improved thankfully, and I make a significant amount of money: more than they are making. My dad keeps making comments about how he is so glad I'll be able to take care of them now financially as I don't  think they have anything setup for retirement. They keep making frivolous purchases and are still being irresponsible with their money. I have a lot of financial goals I want to achieve and I have not factored in paying for their living expenses in their old age. I am bitter that they blew all of their money and the money that they did have, they did not use to take care of me growing up. I have worked hard for my wealth and I do not feel as though they deserve a significant share of it. AITA for not planning to support them?"
3925,AmItheAsshole,"AITA For Telling My GF To Not Dye Her Hair, And Getting Angry When She Did?","READ , I KNOW THE TITLE SOUNDS BAD.

This has really been bugging me, so here we go.

Throwaway and all fake names btw.

So Sarah (24F) , my (25M) girlfriend (now ex I guess) had always had these random... 'style changes' I guess?

Like one day she'd wear skirts, or a simple dress shirt and the next she's wearing shorts and crop tops,  halter tops, tank tops etc. so her style changes *a lot.*

It bothered me, since she is very attractive, and whenever we'd go out, she gets stares and has even gotten hit-on, because they think she's single.

So, she wanted to get highlights, and her sister had this store-bought highlight thingy, and before the pandemic she borrowed it to do it, and I managed to convince not to do it, so she forgot about it and now she remembered and wanted to get dark purple highlights.

I rather prefer girls with un-dyed hair, it's just a preference so I told her that I'd rather she not do that, since it wouldn't really look good on her, and she'd ruin her hair. She told me that she thinks it'll look good on her, and plus she'll be able to just highlight them brown, or fully dye her hair back to brown if she doesn't like it.

I told her, that I wouldn't like it, since it'd ruin her hair, I didn't mean to come off controlling. She just shrugged. And we went to sleep after that, I thought it was the end of it. Then the next day, I woke up to her making breakfast with *purple highlighted hair.*

I asked her why she did that, since I told her it wouldn't look good (I still didn't like it) She said she had a 'change of heart' and that it shouldn't matter what she looks like cause personality matters

Then I said to her, she should have told me if she was going to do it, and she asked why, and I told her I'd rather know if my girlfriend was going to damage her hair. I should have chosen my words better, cause she got all defensive and told me that I shouldn't have a say in what she does with her hair and how I 'manipulated' her last time. So amidst the whole fight, the breakfast got burned  , and we were too busy arguing so it was too late to save the food and we had to throw away food.

I was tired so I said out of anger that 'This wouldn't have happened if you had just listened to me and stop being a child.'

Sarah then started yelling at me *again* saying I should cook for myself and that she shouldn't have to be my maid. I told her that she does those things by herself, I can cook and clean, but she does that so I see no reason to dismantle the system, and she likes cooking. Then when I thought the fight was over, and that she would make breakfast while I cleaned the bedroom (yes I do clean the rooms sometimes) she made breakfast for herself, ( not me)  and told me she's leaving and 'she's done with me', and now she's at her friends house.

This happened a few days ago, but I feel like she overreacted. So AITA reddit?

Edit-Holy fuck, okay, I get it, I'm the asshole. Stop threatening me. Also by 'dismantle the system' I meant that she liked cooking, and and I barely cooked (she used to nag that I'm doing everything wrong. I didn't mean it in a misogynist way."
3926,AmItheAsshole,AITA for saying my brother isn't going to get a younger woman just because he has money?,"My half-brother (38M) didn't have a ton of luck with women when he was younger, because he spouted off a lot of confrontational, awkward stuff (interrogating them about how many guys they've slept with, etc. his ex told me all about it when I was in my mid-teens and it really pissed me off) He also apparently treated multiple ex girlfriends like a maid. I heard a lot from him as he got older about how he would get a hot younger girlfriend as soon as he got successful - fast forward a few years, and he IS successful financially, but can't seem to get past a few dates with women of ANY age.

I obviously am not on the dates with him, but I have a feeling he's still doing the same rude, entitled stuff he always did. Even if he isn't, I think most women pick up on someone having that FORMER attitude. Now he switched it up and is complaining about how women just want a hot guy instead of one who will provide. I'm 14 years younger than him so there might be a generation gap, but the other day I lost it at him and said: ""women don't have to be tied to a jackass just because he's a provider, and you're not going to get a woman my age unless she's a desperate gold digger. Most of us don't like old dudes just because they have money"" (something along those lines, could've phrased it better). My mom and step dad are calling me now and telling me to apologize, but I feel like he needs a reality check. AITA?"
3927,AmItheAsshole,AITA for kicking my mother out of my house,"I'm (26f) and was born and raised in Nigeria but eventually moved to the US. I have a 5 years old son who I had outside of marriage.

And if you know African parents, you know they disowned me. Very recently I rekindled my relationship with my mum and sister and they came to visit me in January.

First few days were alright. But my mum tried to interfere in my parenting. It's worth mentioning I'm completely dependent on myself and the father is in no way involved in my son's life. So I try my best to make sure my son is always okay. My mother offered to replace the babysitter and i agreed.

Corona happened and lockdown, so I started working from home and spending more time with my mother, sister and son. I noticed my mum spoils him too much but I didn't say anything because well she just got involved in his life and it's her first grandson.

I'm on my laptop doing some work and my little boy comes in asking to take my phone to play. I told him his screentime was over for the day. He throws a tantrum and I say no very bluntly numerous times.
 
He starts screaming, crying and telling me my mother is better than me. My mum walks into the room and tried to persuade me infront of my son, at that point I got very frustrated and felt disrespected. Again I say ""no means no"", I made sure my son know the meaning of this ever since he was younger. My mum then stares at me and says ""oh don't tell me you're teaching your son all this feminist talk"" I tell jer that's my son and I choose how to raise him.

Now at this point, to an african parent, it's like i just commited 3 homicides at the spot. I'm never the type to talk to my mum or any elder like that but she was getting to my nerves. 

She then proceeds to tell me that's what the west had taught me and she regrets ever giving me the chance to leave nigeria to become this person she doesn't recognizes anymore.

I value my morals so much and I'd never willingly put anyone at that situation so I just sucked it up and apologized. 

A few days later I found her instigating my son against me and constantly telling him not to take me seriously and if I say ""no"" he should just insist more and he'll get what we want. 

It got too much therefore I told her to either stop interfering in my personal choices on raising my son or she's welcome to leave my house.

She got so angry and screamed at me packed her things and left. I have no idea where she and my sister are right now but I know they have enough money to keep them going through these days so I don't feel that guilty about them not being with me.

I thought about it too much and I think I'm really compromising my culture and morals since I've came to America and I'm not sure I did the right thing. My aunties from back home all called and showed disappointment in what I've done. I tried to dial my mum and she completely ignored me. And now my son doesn't want to talk to me and refuses to eat and says I'm the bad guy."
3928,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my sister she needs to lower her standards.,"My sister is 37 and has been mostly single for the past 3-4 years. She's a doctor and is working like 70 hours a week on occasion and the hours can be brutal. However, she takes time for herself and she's quite attractive (if that's not creepy to say). Plus, she's very intelligent and well-read and can discuss a ton of different things.

She's been complaining to me about her dating life a lot lately, saying how she can't find any guys that want to date her that she also wants to date. I have obviously asked her the reasons, and the main ones are she's looking for someone close to her age who's also career-driven like her, and more importantly, he must also be her intellectual equal. And he must also not be unattractive - to her at least.

I'm usually in ""hang in there and keep trying"" mode when these discussions happen, cause I don't want to upset her, but last weekend - after what felt like the 100th time she was starting that discussion - I tried to gently explore the subject that her expectations might start becoming a bit unrealistic as she ages.

She exploded on me.

All I told her was that, in my experience, finding a man like the one she's looking for is really hard, cause smart, hard-working, successful guys in their mid-late 30's or early 40's are generally all married by that point. So maybe it's time for her to lower her standards and go for one of the many men that do pursue her. 

She got angry and told me she would go for them, but they all get intimidated by how more successful she is than them and that turns her off. So she now just disqualifies them from the get-go, cause she knows that it's a waste of time and said that ""I don't have a fucking clue what I'm talking about"".

And then I got a bit defensive and we had a fight that went off on 3 billion different tangents. AITA?"
3929,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my brother I don’t want him and his kids in my house any more,"I have exotic pets, large reptiles and small mammals.

His kids come over and start going in cages and leaving them unlocked and giving me a heartattack trying to find my pets they released (surprisingly none have killed each other yet) 

I told him he needs to leep a better eye on them or Im going to ban them from my house.

Today they caused my tegu to drop his tail.. which is extremely hard to do they don’t drop it as easily as your random house gecko it takes a lot of trauma

So I kicked them and my brother out and said they aren’t welcome back until they learn to respect me and my animals.

My mom called me and said Im being a massive prick it’s “just a lizard” she actually called him a snake but..

First off I’m expecting around a $600 vet bill from this as I have to get him x-rayed to make sure it dropped in a way that didn’t harm him and if you know anything about tegus you know they have the intellect of a 3-5 year old child.

Second this isn’t the first time they were warned.

Third my brother told me to just buy locks for my cages, It’s not my responsibility to pay to have my cages locked and i don’t want the additional hassle of having to lock and unlock cages twice a day and some cages don’t even have a way to install a lock


Me-23M brother 32M his kids 10F and 8M 

AITA

TLDR: brothers kids don’t respect my animals so i kicked them out

edit: i love how people are making assumptions about my family being sociopaths or having other issues, or assuming I’m a bad pet owner for not reacting sooner (I did react I never said what I did the previous times good on y’all to just assume I ignored the previous behavior) and people acting like me being emotional is undeserved.. which honestly i hope someone kicks your dog so you can talk to me again about “being emotional”. 

Some of you are just commenting based on the info given, thank you. Some of you are making a lot of assumptions and honestly that’s unhealthy of you.

At the end of the day they may be pricks but they are still my family.

My mother raised us all with a very very old school mentality when it comes to animals and sadly it stuck with my brother and stuck to my nephews. I was hoping that being around me with my strict rules and education would help but it did not. I love them but at the end of the day I have to take action to protect my animals and that means punishing them if my brother won’t do it.

They enjoy coming over because i have the animals, im a good cook, and I have lots of video games. 

So hopefully they learn that if they can’t follow rules and respect my animals and by extension myself they can’t have the nice things. Maybe they learn and I teach them respect because obviously my brother is failing on that regard, or they don’t. Either way Ive done my part in keeping my animals safe, and can say Ive tried long enough and hard enough to do my job as their uncle to teach them."
3930,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my friend about my biggest fear and unintentionally offending her?,"My friend was concerned for me since the lockdown has started and on a video call told me of her concerns and that she was worried about me. I appreciated the fact she was so caring for my well being as it came from a good place and thanked her but reassured her that I was fine. She said to me that I wasn't fine as she had noticed that I'm being paranoid about my weight, now more than ever and was fearful incase I was developing a problem. Luckily I'm not, I haven't been doing anything to harm myself as I know that would be stupid and have only been feeling low. I will repeat, I have only been feeling low and haven't been doing anything.

My friend kept asking me to talk to her and I kept saying no that it is a private internal conflict I'm trying to get over. She kept pressing saying ""I'm your best friend, you know you can talk to me"". After that I thought she was right and that she (of all people) is someone I can trust. So I revealed my biggest secret that I have never disclosed to anyone except my psychiatrist. I have a bad phobia of getting fat. To explain, it stems from an awful experience I had that I did end up getting fat and became a shell of who I was. I'm terrified of getting fat because I now associate weight gain with these awful experiences. I never want to be that way again. It is completely internal and I don't project onto others. I told my friend all of this, actually went into more than I can say here, she is aware of these experiences but she didn't know I associated getting fat with them. She did know I was seeing a psychiatrist but didn't know why.

My friend changed from concern to anger, she was very offended saying how unbelievable I was and how that is the vainest shit she has ever heard. She said that not only was what I said vain but incredibly offensive to larger people as I think it is a bad thing. I said that I don't project and that this is entirely about my own issues and trying to work through it. My friend didn't listen and started getting angrier saying that I was a heartless bitch making out like being fat is so terrible. She ended the call and now I'm left thinking was what I said really that bad. Although I'm thinking this, I'm not going to apologise for how I feel. She did ask and I did answer under the assumption that she would understand as my best friend. So AITA for telling her and unintentionally offending her?

Edit: before anyone asks, no I do not have an eating disorder and don't have a history of eating disorders. My psychiatrist and I have spoken about these things before and she has said it herself that I clearly understand that eating disorders aren't the way to do things and determined I'm low risk in developing one.

Edit 2: That bad experience was the only time I got fat, I wasn't a fat up until the experience. After I got out of it I lost the weight but I am genuinely terrified of getting fat again because I associate all the pain and grief with fat. 

For example; If I put on 7 pounds I get anxious, feel extremely low and refuse to let people see me out of fear I'm back to the way I was. All the negative emotions come back.

QUESTIONS:

1. Is your friend overweight?

She is but says she isn't. I tend not to bring it up.

Edit 3:

I went into full detail as to why I have this fear to my friend, I can't say here because it violates multiple rules and is unpleasant.

Edit 4:

I'm not skinny, I'm average. Last time I weighed myself I was about 80kg (12st5 or 176lbs) and I'm 5ft11. That was about a week or 2 ago.... I don't weigh myself often."
3931,AmItheAsshole,AITA for refusing to sell my car to help save my girlfriend’s dog?,"My girlfriend has been out of work since late March due to the pandemic. I’ve been working 3 days instead of 5 since early April so money is kind of tight for the both us. Her dog recently got sick and after a visit to the vet she learned that it will need surgery and further treatments afterwards my girlfriend doesn’t have the money so she’s asked me to trade in my car and get a cheaper one. She got her car appraised and even if she sells it it won’t be nearly enough to cover the surgery. I drive a pretty nice sports car and selling it will be enough to cover the surgery and I’ll be able to buy a used car later. 

I told her I needed to think about it and she got very upset. She’s had this dog for 8 years and she’s very attached to it. She asked what there is to think about because it’s a living thing over a car. She also pointed out how I didn’t even work for the car and my dad bought it for me as a graduation gift ( He just paid what I still owed on it but I used a lot of my own money from my part time job to make the down payment and made payments for 2 years)

After thinking about and discussing it with my family I kind of think she’s asking a lot of me. I told her that I wasn’t comfortable with selling my  car. Her sister called me yesterday and told me how depressed she’s been because her dog is suffering and is probably going to die. She said I’m an asshole for choosing a car over a living creature. I think this relationship with her is over and we’ll probably be breaking up soon.

Edit: Just so there’s no confusion and I can get a fair judgment I won’t be without a car if I sell my sports car. I’ll be able to buy a used car and be able to pay for the surgery. She’s upset that I’m choosing a luxurious car over a more modest one when it could save her dogs life. I apologize if that wasn’t clear in the post

Edit 2: She just posted something on her story about how she’s losing a boyfriend and a dog and that she wasted 3 years of her life so I guess we’re no longer dating? She’s told some of her friends about this and while a lot of them took her side one of them texted me that if she were my that she’s being unreasonable and that if she was my girlfriend she would never ask me to do something like trade in my car. So there’s that I guess"
3932,AmItheAsshole,AITA for refusing to tutor my brother's kids until he apologises?,"I'm a teacher. I have qualifications in all core subjects (English, maths, science), and I teach primarily English at my school, as well as occasionally maths and science, and tutor in all of these subjects.

My brother has always believed in ""those who can't do, teach"", and my career has always been a hot button topic because he says that it's ""not that impressive"" and that it's ""not like you're going to change the world"". His favourite critique is saying that I'm not a ""professional"" in my field(s) because I'm ""just a teacher"". He also likes to brag about how he runs his own company and built it up himself, when it's actually a family business he inherited from our dad. He's smart, but always talks about how meaningless exams are as he only earned basic passing grades and now doesn't need anything he learnt in school.

And now my nephew, a 15 year old taking his GCSEs next year, has just been informed of his predicted grades based on mock exams. His highest predicted grade is a 3, which is the equivalent of a D grade and technically categorised as a fail. And that's the highest, all of his other grades are predicted at 1 and 2, which are E/F/G/U grades. My brother is now nervous because it seriously looks like my nephew is going to fail all of his exams and have to resit GCSEs. His brother, age 12, has similar results.

My nephews, having seen their mock results/predicted grades, didn't care at first because, like their dad said, ""I won't need them once I finish school"". My brother has finally realised the gravity of the situation and his wife (my sister in law) has made him sit all 3 of his kids down and say ""you need your GCSEs, you need to do well in school, I am going to ask aunt OP to tutor you all.""

The youngest is bright, and she'll do fine without help, but the older 2 need help learning basic revision techniques, studying the material they need to know, and generally prepping for exams, with my older nephew being the more urgent case and the younger nephew having a few years to fix it. Both boys are currently anxious because my brother has told them that they will fail and that where we are you have to have a minimum of a C in at least English and maths to get a job most of the time.

My brother called me and explained their grades, what he'd told them, and asked when I can start. I said that I'd start as soon as he admitted he was wrong or aplogised for making fun of my career. He then told me to go fuck myself and hung up. I've since received a call from my sister in law, who I've been friends with since before she and my brother got together, saying it was hard for him to ask for help, but wanting an apology is pushing it, and can't I just do this for my niece and nephews who need help without requiring my brother wound his pride further.

AITA for wanting an apology before I start?

Edit: just to be clear - I do fully intend to tutor his kids, whether I get that apology or not. I wouldn't let the boys fail such important exams, and I believe my niece, who is 10, has the ability to pass the 11+ exam (which her brothers failed) and get into the school I teach at, which I want her to do because I think she would thrive here. I just went into this thinking it would be really nice to get some sort of aplogy from him and that somehow escalated into me wounding his pride, so if it looks like I'll never get that apology then I'll do it anyway, but if it looks like an apology is a possibility then I'd like to hold out until I get it."
3933,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my daughter to shut up and that not everything is about her?,"We have 4 kids. Our son who is 34 and married, our daughter 32 who is single and our fraternal twins (m and f 25). Our son is in a long term relationship and our daughter is engaged to be married. 

Right now we are all planning the wedding of our younger daughter Anna. Our other daughter Sarah has been...... Not supportive to say the least.
We tried to cut her some slack at the beginning because Sara's long term partner of 4 years had cheated on her a year prior. They had talked about marriage so she always thought that she would get married before Anna.

So when Anna announced her engagement 2 months ish after Sara had split with her partner and Sara went crying to the bathroom, I asked Anna for some sympathy. Even if that had dampened the mood Anna didn't seem to mind much.

But this has been a trend since then. Everytime we bring something up that has to do with the wedding Sara starts pouting and we end up Consoling her and talking about her. I wanted to stop enabling her and suggested she get some counseling. Because while it was very hurtful it could not stop her from living her life. She blew up at me and accused me of favoritism. I was very stunned because, while we have done many things wrong, we have never favored one child over the other. We gave them different kinds of support but the same kind of love (e.g our oldest was always the weakest in math so he got a tutor in school while our youngest son didn't get a tutor but he got classes in guitar because he was keen on that).

So here I might be the asshole. After that fight following happened. Where we are everything is opening up again. So the bridal store where we had an appointment called us and reassigned it to last Thursday, with restrictions. We could be 2 people besides the bride and we had to minimize the dress choices to 3. Well of course Anna asked Sara if she wanted to come with us and Sara just started berating Anna that she had been a bad sister for these last few months, that she should be ashamed, that she was selfish etc. I tried defusing the situation, reminding her that it was not fair what she was saying. That she was speaking from a place of hurt but that she should not lash out on her sister. Sara kept going screaming, crying etc. Anna started crying and even our sons came to look what was going on. It got so much that I slammed my hand on the table and said very loudly (not screaming)to shut up, that not everything in this life was about her and that we had been as patient as we could offering an open ear and everything that was in our hands to ease her pain but that we would not stop living our life's because of that. Sara called me a bitch and stormed out.

I feel awful . AITA?


Edit : I thought this might be important. We don't talk all the time about the wedding. It has been a more frequent topic in these last 2 moths especially but before that it was very sporadically.

Edit : wow this got kind of big. I went to bed after just a few replies. I am reading every single one.


As for one question that keeps coming up. The things with my sons is comparable because my oldest really stressed himself out with math. Would study hours with no result. So getting him a good tutor was life changing. My younger son has always been an over achiever in school. He didn't really have a subject that he was weak in. But he constantly overworked himself and stressed himself out. Which is why the guitar lessons come in, they were an outlet for his stress"
3934,AmItheAsshole,AITA for calling my SIL a 'fat fuck'?,"Just want to say first that it wasn't supposed to be an insult.

So we've been staying with my father in law and my sister in law. My SIL is a bit on the overweight side and since she's a stand up comedian, she often uses that in her routine. She's very comfortable in her body and always has been according to my husband.

She tends to joke around and would say this like ""Get a fat fuck some breakfast"" when we're cooking and we always break into laughter. It's just her thing. The problem is that she's now trying to convince my daughter to eat through her cravings. Whether she's craving a bunch of chips and soda or whatever big meal she's feeling, my SIL is promoting it. Her 'logic' is that our body wants what it wants. I hear all the body acceptance and I'm glad my daughter is starting to care less about what others think about her weight but this is ridiculous and unhealthy.

So yesterday we were up late listening to my FIL's stories and my daughter said she felt like some waffles and ice-cream. My husband told her she can have in the morning but then my SIL jumped in and said he must let her have it since she's clearly hungry. My husband spoke some more and then she turned to mt daughter and told her not to listen to him because he's judgemental so i jumped in and said something around the lines of ""That rubbish is unhealthy [SIL], do you want [daughter] to also be a *fat fuck*?"". 

Why I said it? Well I wanted to reprimand her from trying to overrule my husband and I but I didn't want to make things awkward so I thought I should add a joke at the end to keep things light. Her joke. I didn't expect her to take it as an insult but she did (everyone else laughed) and went to her room. Now she's been acting snappy with me and barely wants to be in the same room as me. My husband says it was asshole-ish but I didn't mean harm so it's fine. Aita?"

So basically, my friends dad always comments on things in my life but makes it like things only happen to me because I’m gay. Here’s an example: I’m studying law, her dad said that I’m studying law because “gay people like fucking bad boys” - meaning I only want to be a lawyer so I can have sex with clients. I currently have a cold sore, he said it's because I'm always sucking dick. If he finds out I'm reading a book, he'll tell her that it's ""probably a gay porno mag"". It's stupid stuff like that. 

But it really annoys me. At first, it didn't, but then it didn't stop. I also don't know why my friend tells him this stuff - like me reading a book isn't something worth telling your family about. She's told me that ""he's not homophobic, he just doesn't like seeing it."" (I know that's an assholish thing to say, that's not what I want to know). 

In retaliation, I've ended up saying stuff back like ""your dad is just sad that I didn't represent him when he was in trouble with the law,"" ""I got the cold sore from him, he should probably get an STI check,"" or like ""I thought I recognised your dad on the cover of the magazine?"". He doesn't find it funny, and he calls me a dick head, or a ""poof"". My friend also knows I don't like people commenting on my sexuality, or people talking about me when I'm not there. 

AITA for flipping his comments to make him sound gay too?"
3936,AmItheAsshole,"AITA for not donating my eggs to my dad and stepmom, also going no contact with stepmom?","My dad (58) divorced my mom (58 too) 10 years ago, she got custody of me (24F) cause she made more money and is able to provide a stable home for me. Mom never remarried. He remarried my stepmom (441) two years ago and she’s a very nice woman. They’re very much in love and there are no hard feelings on any side of the family.

At the beginning of the year, my stepmom called me to tell me that she’s heartbroken cause she can’t have bio-children. She and dad have been trying, but they couldn’t conceive because she was infertile after many doctor’s visits. I think she didn’t want to accept that news, so she went to others to have someone tell her that the tests are wrong.

While I’m close with them, I’m not comfortable with knowing that type of intimate detail.

Stepmom told me that she’s looking into in vitro and she’s always wanted a child like me. I don’t consider myself special, but she wants me to be a mold for a biological child. She asked if I could consider donating my eggs to her and use dad’s sperm to make a child with the closest DNA match to them. I don’t understand her logic.

Dad is obviously against it and so is mom, but stepmom doesn’t think it’s wrong because it’s not like we’re fucking.

This dropped on me after a week of back and forth between us, she wouldn’t let it go and wants me to reconsider.

I was super uncomfortable when she mentioned using my eggs and dad’s sperm. Then it reached inappropriate when she insinuated that sex even crossed her mind.

She roped my dad’s side of the family in the matter. They’re religious (old beliefs) and believe in patriarchal. Dad doesn’t have an heir to take the family name because they don’t see me as worthy of being the head of the household.

They’ve been bombarding me with messages and calls for my selfishness, saying I’m depriving a good woman of a chance to be a mother and denying my father’s right to have an heir (mom & dad agreed to one child). The family is accusing mom of shoving her western independence view on me when I was a child.

I’ve since cut contact with that side of the family and stepmom. I’m too sickened by the thought of it. Things are awkward between Dad and me, so I went low contact with him.

Now, I’m starting to think if I’m making a big deal out of it. She’s right, we’re not doing anything inces\*uous. I know I have the right to say no (but really guilty for crushing stepmom’s heart), but am I overreacting by blocking stepmom too?

Lay it on me, Reddit. I built a thick skin from dad’s family. It’ll hurt differently from objective strangers, but I need it.  Am I the asshole?

Edit: stepmom's 44, not 441 years old.

Info: many of you mention the legality issue. My stepmom is from the same country as my dad, she shares similar beliefs with his family's religion. I'm not aware of a lot of the details of her plan, she only asked me to donate. I should've put in that she wants the 'child' to have her country's citizenship, not the U.S citizenship. She has access to IVF in her homeland, but I didn't think it would raise many comments about legality. It's why I mentioned my dad's family's patriarchal beliefs. Dad, stepmom, and his side of the family only have green cards. They have access to their country's healthcare, but she's not letting go of the possibility of me. I don't know the laws of their mother country, I was born here and I never stepped foot in the other country. I couldn't put the info in due to the character limit. I'm so sorry for the missing information."
3937,AmItheAsshole,Aita for telling my boyfriend his masculinity was fragile after accidentally telling his friends he likes to be pegged,"My boyfriend loves to be pegged and I thought his friends knew. He invited two of his friends over and they noticed my strap on(I must of forget to put it away). They asked what was that for and I said for when I peg him. His friends laughed and thought it was a joke until they realised I wasn’t joking. Then there was some awkward tension in the room and then my boyfriend asked them to leave. He was really mad and said that his “boys” don’t need to know about his sex life and that they are going to make fun of him. I told him his masculinity was fragile and told him that his friends are immature. He left our apartment and said he was going on a walk until he calmed down. 

Aita for calling him out

Edit: ok I understand  I am an asshole you can stop commenting now

Edit 2: well he’s kicked me out and says he’ll think about our relationship while I’m gone so I guess all of you where right"
3938,AmItheAsshole,AITA for asking my friend to dye her hair for our wedding?,"I am getting married next month.  I WAS very excited, but then the pandmeic happened, and everything has been chaotic.  I've never been married before, so there is still some excitement there, however, there have been minor spoilers all along the way.  Back to the story!  Our wedding is just around the corner, so I've been busy making sure I get all the small details done.  Because of this, I haven't been on many social media platforms in a while.  Last weekend, my fiance showed me a picture of one of the girls in my wedding party with very bright purple hair.  She loves it, as the post states that, and it really does look good on her.  I was shocked by the choice in color, as I've known her for many years, and she has never dyed her hair a color that wasn't considered natural. I thought on it for a couple of days, and finally decided to call her. I told her I loved her hair, was happy that she loves it, but at the same time, would prefer that it not be that color for the wedding, and that I would cover all expenses.  I explained that I do like it, however, during the ceremony she will be right next to me, as well as in most of the pictures, and, while I don't take offense to the color, I would like the attention to be on my fiance and myelf, and that I feel her choice in hair color will take away from that. She became extremely defensive and upset, and refuses to see my side, or understand my feelings on this.  We talked for a bit, she explained her feelings and reasons, and while I understand where she's coming from, I still would prefer her to change her hair color. I offered multiple solutions that wouldn't require her to dye her hair again, but all attempts made by me were shot down.  The conversation ended with her saying she had to go and hanging up on me. So Reddit, AITA for asking my friend to change her hair color for our wedding?

&#x200B;

EDIT - Since this seems to be a common theme in the responses, I feel the need to clarify a few things:

1. People have assumed she's my bridesmaids, but she's our officiant.
2. The reference of the attention being on my fiancé and myself was made as far as us looking back at our wedding pictures.
3. I would normally NEVER ask someone to do this, BUT I am fairly conservative, and this is something completely out of character for her, which she, herself has admitted.  She said wanted to try something new and different.
4. I did not ask her multiple times, I asked her once. I offered multiple solutions, most of which  would allow her to keep the hair color but would also compromise to the conservative aesthetic of the wedding. 
5. Some of the solutions I offered:

\-I would pay to have her hair taken back to her prior color AND to pay to have it taken back to purple.

\-I would pay for a powder ""dye"" which doesn't dye the hair, it conceals the color and washes out.

\-I would pay to purchase a wig of her choice and have a salon put it on and style it.

3939,AmItheAsshole,AITA for speaking in a different language on the phone with my parents?,"I'm not a native english speaker and my parents are immigrants. They don't speak the language fluently so whenever I'm talking to them on the phone I have to speak our native language. This however upsets some people, who for some reason feel uncomfortable about this.

In particular one of my ex-roommates told me that she was irritated by me speaking another language in our house and that it felt like I was shittalking her (which I have never done...I'm not the gossip-y type and I have more important things to talk to with my parents on the phone than my roommate).

I tried avoiding this by going outside whenever I wanted to talk to my parents, but even then sometimes I couldn't go outside (it was raining or similar circumsances) and people outsidereacted even worse to me talking in another language on the phone (one guy insulted me and spit on the floor after hearing me talk on the phone).

What am I supposed to do? I just see it as a private conversation with my parents...they're both nice people, just a bit old."
3940,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not having a maid of honor anymore?,"So this happened about a year ago, when I got married.

I got engaged in February 2019. I told my oldest/lifelong friend and asked her to be my maid of honor. She was super happy and said yes. For context, we grew up together and lived together years ago, but we've gone long periods of not really talking or hanging out as our lives took us in different directions. But we have a lot of history and always considered each other ""best friends"" so it made sense to ask her.

She got super excited and she started sending me tons of messages every day of flower arrangements, bridesmaids dresses, venues, etc. I told her i wasn't ready to make any firm decisions or seriously start planning since it was a ways away, and my fiance and I are not traditional wedding type of people so most of that stuff wouldnt be necessary or a big deal to me. I planned for the summer of 2020 so my fiance and I would have lots of time to plan for and pay for it. 

Then in March 2019, a month after we got engaged, I got pregnant. My fiance and I decided to get married before the babys birth (it was important to me), and preferably in the first trimester before I was really showing (everyone knew I was pregnant I just didnt want to be super pregnant in my wedding dress). So we decided on a small, 20 person, all family and 4 close friends including my lifelong friend, ceremony in a local park with a lunch at my fiance's parents house after. 

Because it was so small, we no longer needed any of the stuff she had reseaeched about, and we decided to cut the wedding party. When I told her, she said ""so I'm not your maid of honor anymore? Am I even invited then?"" I told her we just weren't going to do any of the traditional wedding stuff, people could come in Jean's and a t shirt and it was all super informal. But she was the only non relative I was inviting from my side so of course she was special to me.

She got upset and barely said anything to me about the wedding after that. Never asked me about my pregnancy or anything either. She texted me 15 before the ceremony telling me she was just leaving her house and showed up at the end of the ceremony. To this day I know she holds a grudge. So, AITA?

ETA: Thanks for your input everyone! I agree that I should have considered the title of MOH to be more important to her than I did. I thought making her a MOH in title when there was no best man and nothing to do would seem like a pity title (which honestly it would have been, considering we decided we didnt want any traditional things and would have done it just to appease her), but maybe it would have been better as I'd already asked her. 

I was going to ask her during the ceremony to sign as a witness but she was late and missed that part. But she didnt know that beforehand so I didnt include it as she didnt intentionally not show up to do it, and I didnt tell her after either. 

But anyway, I dont think I deserved her reaction, but i understand her hurt feelings and do owe her an apology for that for sure.

Thanks everyone!"
3941,AmItheAsshole,AITA for refusing to give back the jewelry my ex gave me,"So a few years i was with this guy who liked to spoil me with jewelry and trinkets. Not once did i ever ask for them, i would go over to hang out with him and hes give them to me. In the time we were together he gave me a few gold plated bracelets, some heart necklaces, raw amethyst earings from his florida vacation and a gold plated engagement ring. We got engaged just before i moved out of stay. A couple months after moving in he started to ignore all my messages and after three months of this he finally messaged me saying that hes been cheating on me and that its over between us. He was very cold about it qnd then he asked for all the jewelry he gave me so that he could give it to his mistress. Including the ring which he claimed was his great grandmother's (isnt true, he used this to guilt trip me. He got it from walmart) i got pissed and told him he wouldnt be getting a thing from me and that instead of ignoring me like a coward he should have just told me straight up before cheating and hurting me so deeply. He then went on to get his mother to try and guilt me to give up the gifts and i started to ignore them. He messaged me again just a few month ago that i was a heartless bitch and because he didnt have the ring he promised the mistress she left him

So am i the asshole?

Edit- since some people are telling me about laws regarding engagement rings i do want to clarify that the rimg he bought forcthe purpose was not labled as an engagement ring by the seller and i only know this because i looked into the ring after we broke up. Does that make any difference or would these laws still imply with it?

edit 2- in light of the legality to the ring ill try and reach out about sending the ring back"
3942,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not letting a pregnant woman in front of me in the line ?,"I (F23) am currently staying at my girlfriend’s (26) apartment and yesterday she wasn’t feeling well. She had really bad cramps, was throwing up and had a really bad headache. We were out of medicine and groceries so I went out to get some. 

I picked up the medicine and went into the grocery store, trying to get to the checkout as fast as possible. I was really lucky that there was no line and was already unloading my cart when a pregnant women asked me if I could let her in front of me. Normally, I would have said yes but her cart was bursting and I had to catch the next bus. Maggie has a car but I don’t drive it because of insurance issues. I really didn’t want to wait for the next bus because I didn’t want to leave Maggie alone for too long and I really didn’t have that many items. I wouldn’t have gone grocery shopping in the first place but the pharmacy is right next to the store and we really needed a few things. 

I told the lady that my girlfriend was sick at home and I would hurry up packing the groceries into my backpack. The lady started screaming that I shouldn’t treat her like that and that young people nowadays don’t know how to behave. She yelled that she needed to sit down and that I would take to long packing up my things. I ignored her, paid and left. In the moment I felt like I was right, but now I‘m overthinking it. My gf is touched that I was so worried about her and the lady was just plain rude. But what if she was really feeling unwell. 

Was I the asshole here ?"
3943,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling strangers off for petting my cat,"I live on a quite dead end road with a large front garden, the garden is 'open' and by that i mean there is no wall or gate separating my garden from the public path in front. The grass just stops and then the public path begins.

I've always had the neighbourhood cats wander around my property ( I have a cat of my own too) and tend to leave food/water out in the back garden for them on their travels.

Since quarantine I've noticed people ( mainly parents with you children) spot cats in my garden an walk over to pet them. It never really bothered me as they would only step a foot or two on my property and try to call the cats over. But some will walk straight over to my door! 

One guy had the cheek to sit on my front garden and watch as his 4 year old daughter played with my cat that was sunbathing on my door step!

I opened the window and tried to politely tell they guy that i didn't appreciate him walking/sitting on my property to pet my cat. The guy tried to guilt trip me by telling me that his daughter always looked forward to seeing my cat and that my cat would never come over when they tried to call it. I got kinda annoyed at that response and told him that he shouldn't be teaching his daughter that its okay to trespass.  He also got annoyed and said i was being 'stupid' and its not like they were doing anything wrong  ( To be fair to the guy he was really calm while we talked)

I insisted that he leave and he did tell his daughter to stop but she upset that she couldn't stay longer.  He just looked at me and said 'Happy now?' before leaving. I feel like such a dick for making her cry but at the same time i'm really uncomfortable with having strangers wandering on my property. Was i an ass-hole? Is what he was doing actually trespassing?"
3944,AmItheAsshole,AITA for convincing my step daughters to move in with me and their dad full time?,"Formatted on a mobile so sorry for the wall of text.

Quick background, my partner and his ex-wife amicably split 5 years ago and they agreed she would have legal custody of their 2 girls. He then met me, we have had another child and we decided to move near the girls mum so we could have them 50% and they could have a relationship with the baby, that was 2 years ago.

Since we have been in close contact it has disturbed me that she borderline neglects the girls - all within the realms of legality, but it bothers me. Her house is filthy (not judgemental just honest - dog poo left on carpets, bread left to go mouldy in bags), she cannot manage money at all, and is declaring bankruptcy now for the third time in her adult life. The girls never have to do homework at their mums, and they are essentially left to go slightly feral. It was a BATTLE to get them back to house rules when they have had a stretch at their mums. 

Over this time I have been encouraging them over as much as possible. For the last year we have had them closer to 75% and behaviour is SO much better. The youngest has asked to move in and we are setting up her room. The eldest has said that she can’t move in because it would effect her mums benefits and her mother has said that she might be homeless/ destitute - I’ve essentially encouraged them to move in anyway. I don’t care that this woman in her late 40’s is a garbage fire, I don’t want her to drag the girls down with her.

Their mother has said to us before that having the girls there is the only thing that gets her up in the morning, but she is such a mess, I don’t want the girls spending their formative years living with her, she has issues that need to be addressed and maybe her girls moving out would trigger her to help herself a bit? Or am I taking away this woman’s lifeline?! She is not an awful person, just a bit of a shitty/ irresponsible parent. 

Ive obviously had many many talks with my partner about this, he wants them here with us too, but because he just wants his girls to live with him again. He feels more guilty about potentially pushing his ex off a mental ledge, I think we both could benefit from the Hive Minds opinion."
3945,AmItheAsshole,AITA for refusing a lie detector game?,"My parents got this lie detector game thing that supposedly checks your heart rate, brainwaves, muscle tension, and breathing to generate a percentage of how likely you to be lying/telling the truth. They're all hooking themselves up for 5 minutes each and everyone can ask as many questions as can be fit into the time frame. 

My family has a pretty good relationship. I'm not going to pretend I don't have stuff I'd rather keep to myself but I know my siblings have a lot more to hide. I don't need a toy to know when I'm being bullshitted and I'd prefer to not be put on blast, embarrassed, and asked compromising questions for 5 minutes straight. 

Apparently me refusing it so vehemently is making everything awkward and I'm pouting. I think it's a horrible idea for them to be doing tbh, but they can do whatever they want and I'd just rather not participate. 

AITA?"
3946,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my wife she should just formula feed,"My wife always complains about breastfeeding. First her nipples were always hurting, and now she always talks about how she never gets a minute away from the baby because it feels like the baby is glued to her chest. 

The other night we got in an argument because she wanted to go to the store and she said there’s milk pumped for the baby if she wakes up and gets hungry.  I told her not to worry about it and I’d go. She snapped and said she always has to stay home with the baby and never gets a minute alone. She was saying how she feels lonely and it feels unfair, how I don’t understand how all of her meals are always cold or she has to scarf them down, and how I don’t understand that she always has to wake up with the baby and even if I were to bottle feed the baby, she’d still have to wake up anyways to pump to prevent engorgement.

I got tired of the nagging and told her she needs to just formula feed and stop bitching about breastfeeding. She had the option and she chose to breastfeed, why is that my fault. I told her if she’d just formula feed then I could help more, but she keeps saying that it’s better to breastfeed and that I’m fully capable of helping her with the milk she has stored in the freezer, even though I was under the impression that she was trying to stock up for when she goes back to work. 

Once again the excuses started so I said either formula feed or shut up. Now she’s mad at me and she hasn’t talked to me in a few days unless it pertains the baby. I told her I was sorry if I hurt her feelings but I guess that wasn’t enough."
3947,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my roommate I won't live with her if she has a baby?,"So me (26f) and my roommate (27f) have lived together for three years. We both go to medical school together and are close friends more than casual roommates. 

Well my roommate has dated this one guy, also in our med school but one year above us, since we both started. They are pretty serious and have been together 3 years. 

During these three years they have had several pregnancy scares all which have ended with nothing coming from it. She always tells me about them and afterwards we always joke about how it's a good thing I don't have to kick her out. 

These not the only times I've brought up not wanting to live together if she gets pregnant. If we are talking about her future kids I usually say ""just wait until after school because you know I'm not helping you take care of the kid."" These conversations have always been light-hearted but I always thought my point was clear, I didn't want to live in a place with kids. 

Well recently my roommate found out she is pregnant. Currently she is weighing whether or not to have an abortion or have the baby. There are a lot of things to consider -- we are in the middle of med school which is a high stress environment with long hours and tons of studying. Her boyfriend is going to be starting his residency in another state and won't be around to help. Her family lives in another state. 

 So one of the things I thought important to make clear was I wouldn't be living in the apartment if she decided to have the baby. Basically I said,  ""look I know we have talked about this before but I just wanted you to also consider how you are going to take care of the baby. I'm not going to live in an apartment with a newborn so you need to take into consideration realistically if you can juggle living by yourself with a newborn while going to school full-time."" I also made clear that while I was more than willing to help her emotionally, I wasn't going to help with childcare. 

Well my roommate blew up. She told me I was an AH to even bring up moving out at a time like this and that no real friend would abandon her for getting pregnant. I tired to make it clear that I wasn't kicking her out of the apartment, that I would be more than willing to move and help her find a new roommate/new housing for her and just the kid. Our lease isn't up till August so we would have till then to figure something out. I just wanted her expectations to be clear -- that I wasn't going to be around to play second mom. But my roommate thought I was being selfish and said I was a bitch for bringing it up before she even decided if she was going to keep the baby or not. 

So basically, AITA for saying what I said? Or should I have waited later to tell my roommate that I wouldn't live with her if she had a baby?"
3948,AmItheAsshole,AITA for calling out my friends delusion when she said people have told her about her weight and said she and I are the same?,"My friend is severely overweight, I do worry about her and tried to say nicely about her weight in the past but she gets very defensive so I don't do that anymore. I left her to it, if she isn't going to listen then there is no point. Last time I have mentioned my concerns was 3 years ago. Ive known her for 10 years, in the last 3 years I did put on a significant amount of weight and lost it all (was a UK size 10, went up to a size 18 and lost the weight and now a 12/10), my friend has put on weight too as she went from a size 12 when we met and is currently a size 22. She has not lost any weight and does not have any medical reasons for the weight gain (I noticed it's since she moved out of her parents house that this has happened).

Something that I've noticed is over the years, she has started to convince herself that she is smaller than she is. This has raised alarm bells for me, it's all well and good to accept yourself but to outright deny reality is a problem. She would post selfies of herself and her friends tell her she looks ""so skinny"" and say ""omg you look like a size 12!"" And she actually believes that. She has called me saying about how so many people jave said she looks like a curvy size 12 and says ""I know I am and these people know it too, it feels great"". She has said countless times about how we are the same size, how she has lost so much weight and has an amazing diet (she sends snapchats of everything she makes, the food is incredibly unhealthy and an extortionate amout for one person) and shames fat girls who are the exact same size as her because she believes she is smaller than them. The level of denial is now completely delusional. 

So we were on Facetime talking about preference. My friend then said ""You know why I wouldn't fuck a fat person? Because all I see is what I use to be and think it's gross. Not like us, we put in the work and are slim attractive women and I don't want to be with someone like that"". I had enough because it is almost every day she says stuff like this so I said ""I'm sorry I'm going to stop you right there, you need to look at yourself in the mirror and be real with yourself. You haven't lost any weight, the exact opposite has happened and I'm sorry but you sould like you are deluding yourself. We aren't the same and the fact you think we are is really concerning to me, you aren't slim, you're really overweight and I don't know why you keep talking like this. It's worrying me"". My friend did not like that and hung up the call and started texting me that I'm jealous she gets complements and I don't and how I sound like a jealous jerk. Her friends clearly know about this and have started calling me shit and saying I should be ashamed and apologise. I don't think I need too, I'm not going to pander anymore. AITA?

Edit: any time any topic of health comes up she finds an excuse to justify it. Like struggling to walk up asteep hill, I know it's because I dont walk as much and may have been impacted but my smoking (I quit and haven't smoked in 7 months), she says it's purely down to her smoking and that she is healthy other than that.

Edit 2: whenever the topic of weight comes up, I change the topic to avoid saying something that maybe upsetting. This time I didn't because of a few reasons:

1. She is shitting on people who are the same weight as her. That's not okay. To say you aren't attracted to people for weight is fine, that's a preference, but to say that you are attractive and these people aren't when you are the same size just sounds bitchy to me.

2. She isn't being healthy and it has concerned me for a long time. The level she is going is ridiculous especially considering she shits on other people like her. It's all good to be happy but why lie to yourself and be horrible to others to be happy, that is an unhealthy mindset.

3. She has been talking like this constantly, I try to bite my tongue but I can't let her keep going down this rabbit hole.

Edit 3: of course I'm concerned about her health! She is my best friend and like a sister to me. I don't want her developing problems or dying young.

Edit 4: for the people saying ""you aren't concerned with her health and seem more bothered that she said she is the same size as you"". That is to show the level of denial she's in, we are no way near similar and she doesn't appear to recognize that.

Edit 5: I personally don't give a shit if someone is happy being bigger, good for them. The concern is the fact she is living in a fantasy to be happy. That IS NOT accepting yourself, that is the exact opposite."
3949,AmItheAsshole,AITA for getting mad at my boyfriend for peeing in a tupperware?,"Last night my partner had a uni exam that went quite late. I cooked dinner and we ate it upstairs in bed.

This morning I saw that he peed into one of the tupperware containers we keep food in after finishing his dinner. I told him it was absolutely repulsive because that's where we keep food. He said it shouldn't matter because it's just salt water and hed wash it out. I told him it was disgusting and he should throw out the container or mark it because I dont want to use it anymore. 

He BLEW UP and told me I was overreacting and using anger to get my way. He then scrubbed the container and mixed it in with the other Tupperware so I couldnt mark it. 

Now we aren't speaking. He says my reaction was way over the top and all guys do this. I say its gross that he peed in the container and even grosser for trying to hide it from me so that I have to use it. 

So internet people, AITA?

Edit: because people have been asking about the bathroom. We have one, but it's very far away and cold where we live. He has peed in various containers multiple times recently, but always throw away containers (or so I thoight?)

Update: I spoke to him and he still thinks I overreacted. Last week I left food in the fridge too long and it went moldy. He cleaned it. He brought this up and said it's way more disgusting and unsanitary than pee.

Update 2: I threw away all the tupperware. He got mad at me for messing with his things and said he knew exactly which tupperware he peed in, he just wanted me to calm down. I dont entirely trust that but now hes made me get the other Tupperware out of the recycling and scrub them."
3950,AmItheAsshole,AITA for refusing to let my overweight friend ride my horse?,"For background, i have 2 horses. Both are older (mid to late 20s), but one is very old (nearing 30), small (just above pony size and just under 1000 lbs) and has some back and hip issues. She is still in great shape for her age, is very muscular, and still enjoys riding. We trail ride up the mountains near our barn, usually 1.5-2 hours a ride, and they can be difficult and steep, but she does great with me (I am taller but weigh around 115 lbs). 

When I bring friends riding, they ride the smaller, older horse and I ride the younger one. This is because the younger horse is very sensitive and not beginner friendly whereas the older one is not sensitive and great for all levels of riding. Because of aforementioned issues, I am selective about who I let ride her as it’s difficult for her to carry too much weight, especially up the steep hills and for an extended period of time. 

I have a friend who is well over 200 lbs, does not know anything about horses, and asked to ride with me. I said no and was honest about why, but still offered for her to come groom them and spend time with them on the ground. She went straight to the body shaming tactic, I was skinny so I don’t understand, the horse is fine if she’s always galloping around with me, bigger people deserve to ride too, she’s shorter than me so it evens out, I’m gate keeping horses, etc. I just told her my horse was an animal with limitations, not a machine, and that I’m not going to sacrifice her welfare to spare her feelings. She was furious and we haven’t spoken since. Some friends (who all re also not into horses) think one ride would be fine and I’m being an asshole about her weight. I strongly disagree, I even agreed with her that bigger people can ride, they just need a horse suitable for their size and my horse is not that. So, AITA?

Edit: thanks for all the responses guys! This happened a few months ago, but it does get brought up from time
To time still so I was curious to see what this sub would think. 

I understand a similar story was posted not that long ago. That was not me, I just joined reddit this week and I’m sorry for the redundancy but I didn’t see that post beforehand.

Edit 2: I love sharing my horses with my friends and wish I had bigger, younger horses so I could take everyone riding! I have many friends who have never ridden before because of weight, some are in great shape and still too big for her, some are overweight and too big for her. Those friends have enjoyed coming to visit and loving on them on the ground, and that invitation was extended to this friend as well. She’s not too big to ride in general, she would just need a horse suitable for her and unfortunately neither of mine fit the bill. Her size and other issues unfortunately severely limits who I can take riding."
3951,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my father-in-law to mind his own business?,"I (27F) work full-time and my husband (28M) is a stay at home partner. That means I'm the breadwinner in our relationship, but that's fine. It's a role we're both comfortable with me in and I hate, hate, **hate** chores anyway.

Recently my father-in-law has been making me uncomfortable with his comments. FIL has a habit of making 'jokes' about things my boyfriend has done around the house. He will often comment on my SO's FB posts and pictures with comments like 'another day sweeping the floors?' and calling him a 'domesticated maid'.

We recently had them over for dinner and my husband did an amazing job prepping the house and slow cooking the food. I didn't help out at all, since I was at work all day and I arrived home to him having done everything.

When my FIL found out my husband did the cooking, he straight out asked why I hadn't helped. When I told him I'd been at work, he told me that he would never let his wife, my SO's mother, host a dinner party entirely by herself and would at least prepare a side. The big difference between my FIL/MIL and me/my SO is that his parents both worked full time, which isn't our situation. My FIL looked at my SO and told him 'you know you don't have to live like this'.

Here's where I might be TA. I'd had enough and snapped at him that our situations were very different. And I said that I actually didn't appreciate his attitude to my husband's lifestyle and he had no right to criticise either of us when we're both happy in our choices.

As you can expect, it didn't go well. My in-laws left early and things have been weird since. My husband says that he wishes I'd hadn't spoken up and next time to let him deal with it. But I struggle to agree since he always lets his father walk all over him and sometimes his father is criticising me too.

AITA for standing up for me and my husband against my father-in-law?"
3952,AmItheAsshole,AITA for calling out a friend on not acknowledging how lucky she is?,"I will keep this short. Seven friends and I were on a video call the other day catching up on each others' lives. Of the seven, four are married, three have children. One friend, Julie, was gushing about her promotion at her corporate job, saying how she really worked hard for it and she's happy they are finally recognizing her worth to the org. I immediately called bullshit and told her instead of lying about hard work, she should acknowledge that she is incredibly lucky to be where she is. Julie has had everything handed to her on a silver platter. She graduated from a top university with no student debt because her parents paid her way. Despite how she acted in high school and college and the reputation she developed, she still found someone who was willing to marry her. She has two children she conceived with no fertility issues, and her pregnancies have been relatively uneventful. Contrast this with the rest of us who are struggling with student debt, unemployment, failed relationships and fertility issues. It just upset me that she was acting like she had surmounted some incredible challenge, when she was an internal candidate and got a recommendation from her boss. Most companies would rather promote a mediocre established worker than hire outside the org, and while that may have not been the total reason she was promoted, I'm sure it played a role.

She got pissed at me, told me she wasn't going to apologize for the life she was living, and that I had no right to try to shame her. She left the call and we haven't spoken since. My other friends have told me that I sounded bitter, and that I should have spoken to her privately instead of confronting her on the call while she was in the middle of celebrating. They have all drunk the Julie-Koolaid so it didn't faze me that much but a guy I've been seeing told me I did sound confrontational and hostile. He also told me about this site, so I'm here for a judgement. AITA?

&#x200B;

I am editing this to say that while I may have been harsh with how I said what I did and the venue I chose to say it, I still stand by what I said. Julie has had all the privilege in life, and she is ungrateful for everything. And that is all I will say. "
3953,AmItheAsshole,AITA for making “fun” of my fiancée’s beliefs?,"First of, I’m a scientist. I tend to believe in scientific things. If it cannot be proven by the scientific method, then I simply don’t believe in it.
 
Apparently, my fiancée really got into astrology a couple months ago, after we got locked in. Okay, that’s fair, it’s a tough time. The thing is, she’s pretty much a hypocrite. She’s an antitheist, and regularly goes into online discussions and with my parents and points out how ridiculous religion is. I tried to point out the irony here, but she doesn’t see it.
 
I just told her it’s a bit hypocritical of her to make fun of organized religion while she believe that objects light years away have any significant effect on our personality. She just called me an asshole for not being a supporting fiancée.
 
I am a bit socially “slow”, but I’m not on the spectrum. Am I missing something? AITA?"
3954,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my sister she shouldn’t have kids?,"So my (20F) sister (18F) doesn’t have any kids however we were discussing trans kids and my sister said that if her kid came out to her as trans, she wouldn’t accept them. My sister has not always been the best but recently she gotten worse. Using the word f*ggot, using gay as a synonym for shitty, fake throwing up at gay sex scenes on tv (note: this isn’t a twelve year old being disgusted by any sex scene, she only does this with gay sex scenes). As a bisexual this has been really hard for me to put up with so after she made the trans comment, I turned round and said ‘you shouldn’t have kids then and if she did that, that’s how she would lose her kid’ (as in the kid would stop talking to her once they could). My mum just told us to stop having this conversation. AITA for telling my sister to not have kids?"
3955,AmItheAsshole,Aita for refusing to sleep in the same bed as my girlfriend after she wet the bed,"Yes you read that title correctly and no I’m not dating a 5 year old. So about a week ago my 20 year old girlfriend wet our bed and I haven’t been able to sleep with her since. After the incident she cried and was very embarrassed and I told her that it doesn’t matter because it doesn’t change my opinion on her. That night I told her that I was sleeping on the couch and she was hurt but understanding. But now she’s claiming that it’s been a week and that I should sleep with her but I’m still feel not comfortable with sleeping with her. She says me not sleeping with her is making her insecure even though I’ve reassured her that I still love her. 

I was just wondering aita also is it healthy for her to wet the bed(this is the first time in our 9 month relationship that this has happened)

Edit: I’ve realised I was in the wrong but my girlfriend says she doesn’t want to share the bed with me now, which I understand, what can I do now to make the situation better. 

Edit 2: reading these comments is making me worried about my relationship. I think I was grossed out because of my own immaturity and my girlfriend shouldn’t have to put up with that. I realise what I’ve done might make her feel embarrassed around me so what could I do to fix that?

Edit 3: I’m fully aware am the asshole so please can you comment some advice because I don’t want to throw our relationship away because of this.

Edit 4: she’s ignoring me saying she doesn’t want to talk to me. I would say she’s being immature but you guys would kill me in the comment section."
3956,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not forgiving my friend after he humiliated me on a party?,"
I have been very overweight my whole life peaking at 200kg (440 lbs). I managed to lose 50 kg (110 lbs) at some point but over time gained it back, lost it, gained it and so on in a never ending cycle. It was never really an issue for my friends, no one ever mentioned it. When I had courage to change my bad habits I would mention my plans to my friends on our Discord server occasionally, but they just ignored it or just accepted my choices without further interest. It was fine for me though, I never expected anything, I just wanted to share. 

Last year I gained much weight over a very stressful period in my life and had 190 kg (418 lbs) again which shocked me.
I managed to lose 30 kg (66 lbs) over 4 months, but didn’t share my success openly because I once weighed less. 

It is the day of the party, I feel fit, strong and am full of positive energy. After all, Ive been dieting for 4 months and lost a lot of weight. I was proud of myself. I just felt good. 

The party (50 people) was a blast. Later in the night we were playing some card games, someone started the topic of losing weight. We discussed some methods and my friend (Lets call him R) disagreed with me on something. It was actually no big deal, he was drunk though. So it was like 3 am, there were about 20 guests remaining, everyone sitting on a big long table. So now he started to criticize my weight loss, how I lost and gained and lost and gained over the past 10 years and how I am absolutely not qualified to give any advice on losing weight. I took offense to that but remained calm, I knew he was drunk so I just made a joke. He exploded after that, everyone stared at him and all of a sudden he started berating me. How I always post this stupid meals, doing stupid exercises, how I am still fat, i should look at myself, i look disgusting. But then it got so out of hand and actually ridiculous that I started laughing after he said he won’t support me anymore. 

What support? Yes, apparently he supported me over all those years by occasionally thinking about me, not being negative regarding my diets/exercise and praying for me. So I should be thankful.

I stood up and went outside for a moment. The party was ruined for me so I decided to go home. I went back inside to grab my jacket. The host, our mutual friend „B“, was standing next to R. I walked over and wanted to thank him for the party and R started AGAIN with his barrage of insults. B just stood there watching in disbelief, I just said „What a great night“ and left. 

2 hours later R sent me a text that he was sorry and he was kind of an ass. I just answered with „yes“.

B said to me after many weeks of silence that the air seems kind of strange since then and that I should forgive him. He just was drunk. I was like „duck that, I don’t give any sh about him.“ 

So now I am the asshole for „disrupting“ our friendship."
3957,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not letting my daughter (16) watch anime anymore?,"Hi Reddit, a few days ago I had to put my foot down and stop my daughter from watching anime. This needs some context as I don’t want people to think I have an issue with the medium or Japanese culture. 

So my daughter, Marianne, has been pretty obsessed with anime since she was 12. At first I didn’t see a big issue, I was scared about the social ramifications because my older son, Silvio (19), used to tell us about the kids in school that people made fun of called “weebs”. I was scared Marianne would become one of these people but I held my tongue because my wife was of the opinion that children will do what children do. My first problems with her animes started when during our dinners she would start by what she called, thanking for the food in Japanese. Silvio said he saw her do it out in school once which scared me. This was weird but wasn’t the end of the world but, not long after she started wanting to get into what she says is “cosplaying” where a persons dresses as characters from anime I guess. She showed me prices for whatever it is she needed to buy and it was absurdly high. She eventually got her own job with her brother at a local country club so she got to buy her own stuff which was fine until she finally finished her costume last week. What I mean is the costume was finished and she was happy and I was trying to bond with her so I asked her questions about who she’s meant to be. This was a mistake because she described to me that her character was from a show with so much goddamn incest like it was no big deal. I was mortified, I knew she watched some weird stuff but incest was taking it way too far I mean she has a brother like wtf. I told her that from now on she’s forbidden from watching those shows and she flipped out calling me an asshole. My wife was mostly weirded out but compared it to how much porn nowadays relies so much on incest while my son just said he knew she watched things like that and found it creepy. It’s been a few days since and she’s still really upset so Reddit, AITA???"
3958,AmItheAsshole,AITA for blocking a kid with Down Syndrome's shot?,"This happened a little over a year ago, but people still bring it up and are pretty divided over it.

I (M17) am on our school's varsity basketball team. We have another guy (M18) who has Down Syndrome who is also on the team (he sits in both JV and varsity games). We all love him, he's a super spunky kid with a lot of energy who loves watching us and doing whatever he can to help the team. Unfortunately, he forgets things very quickly such as basic in-game rules and lacks a ton of motor skills which leads to him not receiving a lot of playing time. However, his parents stress to the coach and to us as players that we are to do whatever it takes to treat him like a member of the team to the point where it actually gets pretty insane. A quick example: we used to make the last 5 minutes of practice letting him shoot and feeding him balls. He had a great time with it, always smiling. His mother complained to the coach because she felt that it was ""dehumanizing"" and that other members of the team were not given special privileges, so he shouldn't. I personally think that's insane. 

During a scrimmage once, he was put in, but all he wanted to do was shoot. There was a loose ball that he picked up on defense and instead of bringing it back, he tried to shoot at the opposite basket. I, who was on his scrimmage team, went and blocked the shot, and then gently reminded him that it wasn't his basket and told him I would take the ball up the floor and let him shoot at our basket. He agreed pretty happily, didn't seem upset at all. He was fine and normal for the rest of practice. He's a happy kid. 

Later that night, my parents, the coach, and I got an email from his mother in a very angry tone. She basically said I was wrong for blocking him and that I should be suspended from a couple future games. My parents were angry and thought I should've just let him shoot. Some other guys told me that later, and I had to write an apology letter to the guy, who seemed perfectly cool about the entire situation. 

I still wonder, was I TA?"
3959,AmItheAsshole,AITA for Calling Out a Coworker for Poor Zoom Etiquette?,"TL;DR: Boomer joins a team of young professionals on Zoom, behaves badly due to cluelessness, and constantly causes technical problems. The annoyance boiled over and OP lashed out at him. Now OP is being accused by team members of being mean even though they all agreed with me that Boomer was annoying.

So we've been working from home and having daily team meetings with 15+ people. There is a coworker who is both older and a latecomer to the team, let's call him Boomer. We have decided on team meeting rules at the beginning of the arrangement. And I guess Boomer doesn't know about them. We also have a FB group that Boomer isn't invited to. Not that we have anything against him, it's just that nobody wanted to take the first step to invite him since none of us know him  well.

Boomer left a very bad impression on his first day. He was late to the meeting since the host forgot to add him, and proceeded to explain the situation to the group when we were all in the middle of a task. He constantly forgets to mute himself when others are talking and remarks to himself (we agreed on no talking over the microphone, only communicating through text chat, and always raising your hand if you need to speak). We tried PMing him and ask him to mute himself or raise his hand, he would comply, apologize, and make the same mistake after his next turn to speak. Half the time he would ignore our PM altogether as paying attention to both video and chat is obviously too much for him.

Since Boomer was late, doesn't know the rules, and is just clueless with Zoom in general, he is not only slowing us down but annoying all of us significantly. I posted in our FB group after the first day that if he kept this up I will chew him out. And I received unanimous likes and positive comments.

After 2 meetings of putting up with his incompetence, I finally had enough and yelled at him. I told him that if he cannot handle Zoom then he shouldn't be working on this team and he needed to start following our agreed-upon rules or GTFO.

I expected my teammates to back me up but none of them said anything. After the meeting, the host called me and said I was too mean and I needed to apologize to Boomer. And that Boomer had opted to work via email instead of Zoom. But I was only saying what everyone in the room was thinking. And we tried dealing with him politely and it didn't work. I felt betrayed that I was made out to be the villain when in reality I was trying to help the team be more efficient.

AITA?"
3960,AmItheAsshole,AITA for how I reacted to a birthday present,"Pretty sure this is on me, but anyway

  


So I (32M) got given my birthday presents this morning by my wife (32F), straight after breakfast. We've been together for 5 years, and without fail, she always mentions that I'm really hard to buy for. So in the run up to this year, she's mentioned that she had to search around to get my present, as it was out of stock on Amazon

So I'm opening the present this morning, and she mentions that it's something she could share, which in hindsight makes this hilarious, just as I see a label saying ""20 different speeds"". At this point I figured it's some kind of massager, since we both tend to complain of sore backs. I cant tell you what my face was as I'm faced with the product name, Lovely Wand, and the realisation that my wife has bought me a vibrator. My poor, straight laced wife bought me a vibrator, and she wants to share with me.

  


My guess is, that at this stage my face has dropped significantly, since she kinda mentioned that I didn't really like it did I? So I went and explained what she bought, but tried to reassure her we could use it as a massager (it is in the instructions as primarily a massager. just a waterproof, posable, rechargeable massager). She seemed a bit down, and now she's gone to take the kids for a nap, so I'm sitting here feeling bad about how I reacted AITA?"
3961,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not letting my son go to his desired school as punishment?,"My son’s in his final year of middle school and will be starting highschool in a few months. This year he’s been getting in a lot of trouble thanks to a new group of kids he started hanging out with. 6 times my wife & I have been called to the deans office after they were caught ditching class. We’ve received complaints from his teachers that he’s being disruptive in class even after being separated from his friends. 

And now his grades are slipping too. My wife and I have worked closely with him & his teachers to make sure he doesn’t flunk. 
We’ve talked to him many times, and have grounded him from doing any activities.

I’ve been strict with him and enforcing his home punishments (no TV, no phone, no laptop unless it’s for hw), but sometimes my wife lets him get a few hours of tv before I get home from work and tries to cover for him, which we’ve also talked about but she thinks I’m being too hard on him. 

A month before school shutdown, my son asked me to put his grounding on hold because his group of friends were gonna go stay a few hours at a friends house. I said no, he threw a little temper tantrum and stayed mad at me.

When the day came, I reminded my son he’s to go straight home. I was actually feeling pretty sad that day over all the fighting and I wanted us to do something together to remind him I still love him.

 I left work early and got home around the time he should already be there and the house was empty. 

I called every parent but none of them knew which friends house they were at and my son’s phone was turned off. So my wife and I went driving around looking for him. 3 hours of worrying later, my son finally calls. The hangout was over and now he was ready to face whatever wrath awaited him. 

To say I was furious was an understatement and I let him have it soon as we got home. Since every punishment so far didnt seem to be working, I decided the only thing left is to take away his choice of school. 

Beginning of the year, he begged me to let him go to the local HS because it’s where most of his class (and friends) will be transferring too. It’s also where my wife went to school so she wanted the family tradition to continue. I agreed to it but now it didn’t seem like a good idea. So I told him he won’t be going there at all. 

My son lost it and begged me to change my mind, even my wife came to his defense but I still said no. He’s barely talked to me since then and my wife keeps arguing that I’m being unfair to him. That he’s just a boy doing teenage boy stuff. I don’t think I am and that’s not the son I want to raise. He needs to know there are consequences for his actions and if keeping him away from a group of friends that are clearly being a bad influence on him will stop him from getting into trouble, then sending him to a different school is the best option. She’s started giving me the silent treatment too and now I don’t know if maybe I am being too harsh. AITA?"
3962,AmItheAsshole,AITA for complaining after my (32f) husband (35m) called me an incompetent.,"As a little bit of background my husband had a motorcycle accident 3 months ago and his right foot had several fractures, he's doing ok now but it still hurts a lot when he needs to go down the stairs or needs to do strength related things. After the accident one of his friends took the motorcycle home and has been here since, given the stay at home order and the pain on his leg he hasn't been able to move the motorcycle at all. So I (I have no idea hot to ride a motorcycle) have been turning it on for a couple minutes every now and then (after he asked me to do it and explained the basics to me).

Last week I went to turn the thing on and it was completely dead, I have no idea how any of that works but I've seen him turn it on with a lever thingy on the side so I asked him to come downstairs with me and try it. He gave it a go but the pain was too much so he told me to do it, and as you may expect I was pretty unsuccessful.

Today during breakfast he said we would need a mechanic to check on the bike to know if it has any problems given it has been in the house for so long or if I was just incompetent. I asked him to elaborate and he said ""I need to know if there's any damage to the ignition or if is just your incompetence that won't let it turn on"". 

I told him that word was kinda harsh and that he could probably say that in better terms, he is telling me he just used the correct word for not having the ability  to do something and that is not his fault I'm deciding to take the word as offensive and he's not responsible for the way I take his ""context-appropriate"" words.

The conversation just died then and we are not talking right now, I'm kind of expecting an apology from him but he says I'm making a bigger deal than it really is and that it should be me who has to apologize for ruining the mood, and now I'm wondering if I'm just being too sensitive about it, so AITA?"
3963,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not wanting to sleep with so MANY cushions on the bed?,"My (34M) girlfriend (26F) has a LOT of pillows. She likes to put least 10-15 on our bed at all times and still buys more. Which is fine most of the time, it looks pretty nice and makes our bedroom cosy.

So many pillows, however, means that it's really hard to sleep. I've tried moving the pillows to our guest bedroom and she just moves them all back. I've tried asking her if we can get rid of some pillows but she says that 'I can just move them on the floor when I sleep and put them all back in the morning'.

I don't want to do this every single morning. It's a bit of a pain to put them all on the floor before I sleep and pick them up again in the morning.

I finally snapped the other day and told my girlfriend that I can't live this pillow life any longer. I've moved all of our pillows but three to the guest room and that's where they're going to stay.

She got really upset and started crying. She told me that I'm a dick and if I was willing to put in the effort to pick up the pillows in the morning, this wouldn't be a problem. She also said that it wasn't her fault I wasn't interested in making our house look nice.

AITA for being sick of sleeping on a million cushions every. single. night?"
3964,AmItheAsshole,AITA for ‘stealing’ my sisters cat?,"My family has four cats one for each family member, two of them are typical cute cats, the kind that look beautiful in every picture (one of them is even a kitten) these two belong to my parents. The other two cats are less photogenic, mine is slightly deformed and a bit weird and the other is a classic fat ginger and white, which is my sisters.

My sister does not give her cat any attention unless told to. She only gives attention to the two photogenic cats, and she calls them hers but they just aren’t, she also gets jealous if they give attention to anyone else.

So I started to give her cat attention (as well as giving my own cat attention, as he spend 90% of his time with me) and now her cat and me are like best friends. He also spends all his time with me, and never goes near my sister. She accuses me of stealing him, that wasn’t really my intention I just saw an old lonely cat who needed hugs.

Am I the asshole?"
3965,AmItheAsshole,AITA for fighting my brother for feeding me pork meatballs (I'm Muslim),"So my brother and his partner came over for Eid and must've not known what to bring. They ended up bringing some leftover potatoes and meatballs. 
For some reason when they reheated the food in the oven, they left the meatballs in our fridge which I thought nothing of at the time but now leads me to believe they realised and thought they could just sneakily take the meatballs out.
It was my first week back at work and I hadn't prepped food to take so I took the meatballs because I didn't want them to go to waste.
I thought the colour looked funny and that they tasted different to what I was used to but figured since my brother's partner made them that maybe it was just a different recipe than I was used to. 
I couldn't tell from the colour if they were chicken or beef so I messaged them to ask and only then did they tell me they were pork. They've been in my fridge for 2 days and my whole family are Muslim. 
When I told them that's not chill and asked why they didn't say anything my brother replied saying ""my bad I forgot"" and his partner said ""they were delicious tho lol""...
I said ""thanks for bringing them for Eid wow 👍"" and they told me to ""piss off"" and that I was being a sook.
My brothers partner left the chat and my brother said there was ""no need for that attitude wow"".
Instead of arguing about the lack of respect for my boundaries and beliefs (they are not Muslim) I just followed suit and also left the chat. 

For the record, when I visit them and they eat pork or pork products I never judge or comment, I just don't eat them...each to their own. I truly don't care what other people eat, I'm not here to pass judgement when I know damn well I'm not perfect and that every single person is entitled to their beliefs. I just feel so thrown off because I've NEVER consumed pork before in my life (the closest I came was eating cheese and bacon balls when I was a kid and when my mum kindly explained to me what bacon was, my 7 year old dramatic ass damn near collapsed and turned myself in). 

I just think it's a dick move to feed your Muslim family pork (on Eid, no less) and not even apologise for it. I feel like my brother gave a really half-hearted apology after he realised I was pissed and it came from a defensive place, not a sincere or sympathetic one. 

Am I the asshole??????

EDIT: 
So some common questions to clarify...
- Yes, my brother 100% knew it was Eid and we were both brought up culturally Muslim (never strict). I've just been enjoying and appreciating my faith more in adulthood. He's never related to it and that's fine because every. single. person is entitled to their beliefs.
- No, I don't think they did it to deceive the rest of us. I guess when something isn't on your radar from day to day, you don't notice as much i.e. they eat pork so it might not have crossed their minds when they brought it. But am I wrong to think as 2 grown ass adults, they'd at least apologise instead of saying ""my bad lol""...
- I'm aware that I'm not religiously at fault here because I ate it without knowing. I'm not a perfect Muslim but this much I do know guys. Thanks for opting for religious comfort though
- Lastly, I'm gonna disclaim that I was a bit passive aggressive in this scenario and that's kinda a dick move on my part too.

Further question guys: should I be the one to reach out and apologise? They are straight up not speaking with me now because they said I'm a dramatic sook... is it SO outrageous that I just wanted a genuine apology?"
3966,AmItheAsshole,AITA for cutting my son’s hair?,"I’ll do my best to keep this short. I have 3 boys with my wife ages 10, 8, and 7. The middle one is the son in question. Let’s call him Austin. I’m no barber but I know how to cut hair. I cut their and my hair if it gets too long. Last year my son started wanting to skip haircuts and my wife said we should let him grow it out if he wants to. I was reluctant because I care about our family looking neat and presentable. I budged in the end.

Austin’s hair got way longer than I ever would agree to. It is past his shoulders. His brothers tease him for looking like a girl and I wouldn’t be surprised if he got that at school too. I asked my son if he would like to cut his hair. He said no but he’s a child. I talked to my wife over and over about it who insisted that he be allowed to decide for himself. I disagree because I think he’s too young to know what is appropriate or not. I wouldn’t allow one of my kids to wear his swim shorts to school. You have to teach kids by saying no sometimes. When she was at work today I decided to cut Austin’s hair and apologize to my wife for it later. He looks way better. He didn’t want the haircut at first but now says he likes it. 

When my wife got a look at him and heard that I made him cut his hair, I swear steam came out of her ears. I have never seen her so angry. She told me I was a bad father today and refuses to even talk to me. While we were arguing she said she had half a mind to leave me over this. I think she is making a really big deal out of hair that my son does not even miss. I knew she would be angry but this seems like blowing it way out of proportion. Hair grows back. Anyways, AITA here?

Update - Mixed comments but I’ll accept the majority saying I’m in the wrong. Austin talked to my wife this morning and apparently said he misses his long hair. My wife is even more furious if that’s possible. I hope he gets used to it but I may let him grow it out again if he wants to. Thanks"
3967,AmItheAsshole,AITA for lying to my grandma about what I'm feeding her?,"My grandmother (86f) has been asking me to make this specific curry for the past 2 weeks or so.

To make it you need breadfruit, which I could not find anywhere. I've driven around the town trying to find it, but no dice. Instead I've been making the curry using potato. The first few times she asked what's in it, I told her truthfully that it was potato. She looked so sad, and even cried a little. She refused to eat anything those nights. Now when grandma asks what's in it, I reply ""it's breadfruit"". Her face absolutely lights up. She used to have this breadfruit curry as a child, but now can't really tell the difference between it and potato. She's in her 80s, I honestly think she has good memories of eating said food, but can't really remember its taste.

She's going back to a nursing home in a few weeks, and I know that ""breadfruit curry"" will not be a menu option. I'm still running around trying to find actual breadfruit, but until then potato it is.

She's been consistently asking for this for dinner every night, and refuses when I offer to make her something else.

My family found out what I was doing and is kind of split. My sister thinks I'm being incredibly deceptive and should stop lying to her, while my cousin thinks that I'm just making grandma happy before she goes to her nursing home.

Edit: Thanks for sending me links to get breadfruit, but it's really expensive online where I live and I can't stomach spending that much money on just one item. So for now I'll just stick to trying to get it in store, or find tinned ones.  Thanks!"
3968,AmItheAsshole,AITA for supporting my cousins ex-husband over her?,"Context: My cousin, let's call her Star, cheated on her now ex-husband, let's call him Bear, with a co-worker of hers a couple years ago. Previously, she visited our grandparents and aunt to introduce them to her husband at that time, Bear. When Bear left the room, Star started insulting him saying he wasn't the brightest or smartest person which pissed off my family because well..that was her husband. Fast forward after the divorce, he lives with my aunt and uncle to take care of their 2 year old baby, lets call her Sunny, while she's off with her new boy. Custody is split and they alternate times to see Sunny. One week, while at my cousins, Sunny broke her arm. I mean, BROKE her arm. From falling off a couch. And brushed it aside while we and everyone else were going ""How the fuck did you manage to let a 2 year old break her fucking arm??"" But I digress. My uncle and aunt began to favor Bear and Sunny over Star which seemed to invoke rage because one day while at the Hospital (My uncle injured himself after crashing his car) she was pissed they chose Bear over her. She blocked the family and wants nothing to do with everyone. 

Fast forward to November of 2019. Bear has a new woman in his life, let's call her Moon. Moon is an absolutely wonderful woman and a pleasant mother figure to Sunny. My uncle and aunt love her and she seems to love everybody and especially Sunny.  They are engaged. My grandmother throws a ever-loving fit about how this will be damaging to Sunny that Star and Bear are split and seeing other people. She wants them to stay together or at the very least wants Bear to not re-marry so Sunny can have a ""un-normal normal"" life between her two parents. I lost my shit. Star cheated on Bear, a man who loved her to bits and would have struck down any man who harmed her. Just by his gaze you could see how much of a fool he was, being so in love with my cousin. I told her I'd rather she have Bear and Moon as her parents than Bear by himself and Star remarry and fuck whoever else she'd like to. I don't support Star and I hope she apologizes not only to Bear but their daughter Sunny when she's able to understand the situation. My grandmother told me I was wrong for choosing someone outside of the family over Star, especially with my circumstances as to why I'm in the family.   
Am I the asshole for choosing Bear and his happiness over my irresponsible and negligent cousin Star?   

Sorry if this makes no sense, I'll try to edit it if I need to."
3969,AmItheAsshole,AITA for trying to rehome my girlfriend’s kittens?,"My girlfriend has a big soft spot for animals, but she has a HUGE one for cats. I personally don’t mind them but I’m more of a dog person. Every morning my gf goes for a jog and she’s noticed a stray cat that roamed kind of close to our house. My gf, being who she is, would bring her food and water but the cat was too skittish to be caught though she would eat the food my gf gave her. She also noticed that the cat was likely pregnant because it seemed like she’d get more round in the belly. Eventually, she gave birth because she was gone for a few days and when she showed back up she wasn’t as round anymore. One day, gf went on her jog and she found the cat dead on the side of the street. She moved the cat in a close by wooded area where she heard small meows. She eventually found where they were coming from and it was a litter of 3 kittens.  They were about the right age for them to be the dead cats babies. She said she couldn’t leave them there to starve or be eaten so she caught them and brought them home and she’s been taking care of them ever since. They’re about 3 months old now. I feel like my gf spends more time with these cats than with me now. If she’s not working, she’s in the “cat room”. On several occasions she’s fallen asleep on the floor with them. Yes, she still cooks, and cleans but it seems her world has orbited around this litter. They’re cute and all but I’m tired of them being here and I’m over that they get most of her attention. I think the only reason why she wants them is because of a “traumatic” experience from when she was a kid. I’ve been looking for people who might want them and I think I found a good home. This mother and daughter in the neighborhood who I’m familiar with were interested in them. I sent the mother pictures of the kittens and after a little back and forth she agreed to take them. Her and her daughter (~12) came over to see them in person and to take them home. As I’m getting them ready to go my gf comes home and she sees what’s happening. She immediately starts freaking out asking what I’m doing and who are these people. I tell her who they are and they’re here for the kittens. My gf completely lost it. She starts crying and screaming at me to put them down and they’re not going anywhere. She started  scaring our neighbors and I keep trying to calm her down but at that point she’s hyperventilating and crying. She grabs the carrier with the kittens and runs out of the house and drives off. The neighbors basically just left without saying much else. I honestly don’t know what the big deal is? I mean they’re just cats, and I didn’t even really want them to begin with. She won’t answer my calls or texts and I’m getting tired of her being so dramatic about this. AITA?

Edit: I’m having a hard time keeping up. For those commenting about why I said ‘“trauma”’, I put “trauma” in quotes because I don’t think it was THAT bad. And no I’m not allergic or anything, I do sometimes hang out with her and the kittens but I find them kind of... boring and annoying so I lose interest and do something different. Like at least if it was a puppy I/we could train it to do cool tricks and stuff. But they just want to play with strings and feathers and stuff."
3970,AmItheAsshole,AITA for blowing up at my parents after I suspected they were gaslighting me?,"So I (15M) have been looking for my AirPods for about a week now. My parents have been getting mad at me for losing them and have threatened to take away my PC if I didn't find them. Today, I was looking for them again for a few hours and I checked my parents' room, where they were stashed in my parents' drawer. I confronted them each separately and they both claimed it was the other parent moving it there because they thought it was just a case and not the actual AirPods. I proceeded to get angry and harshly accuse my mom of doing it, to which she yelled back, ""You should just be happy you found them."" Am I the asshole for yelling at her?"
3971,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not paying for something that broke when I was babysitting?,"~ this happened before lockdown, but it's still being argued about~ 

My (16F) aunt and uncle came over for dinner, and asked me to babysit their kids (4 year old twins). I refused, I don't have any experience with babysitting and wouldn't know what to do. They kinda pushed me into it, since 'they babysat me when I was a kid, so it's nice to give back' so after talked a bit more I agreed. 

They needed me from 10:00 to 22:00, so babysitting included making lunch/snacks/dinner/bathtime/putting them to bed. I was pretty nervous, and told them that, but they insisted I do it. 

So most of the day went okay. The problem came when I was cooking dinner. I put them in front of the tv with a movie on, but one of them started wandering around and threw my uncle's smartphone (I don't know where he got it, my uncle thinks he left it inbetween the couch cushions) in the toilet. I fished it out and put it in a bag of uncooked rice. 

My uncle thinks it's his fault and isn't mad, but my aunt is. She's insisting I pay for the phone (900 euros or so). My mom thinks I shouldn't have to pay, my dad thinks I should offer to pay half. It's been an argument for a while now. 

I personally don't think I should pay, I don't know how they expect me to watch two toddlers while cooking dinner knowing I never ever babysat before. Plus leaving an almost thousand euro phone laying around when they aren't home. 

AITA for not wanting to pay?

Edit: since some people keep asking: I wasn't paid to babysit."
3972,AmItheAsshole,"AITA for telling my fiance's brother that ""there are personality traits other than dickhead and edgelord""?","Backstory on my boyfriend's brother is that I don't like him and he doesn't like me. My family is comfortable without being wealthy while my boyfriend's family is definitely wealthy, and the brother seems to think I'm a golddigger despite my boyfriend and I splitting everything 50/50. He is the kind of person who will ask the groom on the day of his wedding if he needs a getaway driver and tell people to get prenups at their engagement party, and I'm saying this because I've seen him do both things more than once.


I'm pregnant. It's definitely ahead of schedule but my fiancé and I are happy about it. I'm around 5 months pregnant, my fiance proposed about 2 weeks before we found out. We told his family earlier today over zoom. His mum, dad, and sister congratulated us and his brother did too, but then the brother made a joke about getting a prenup (which we are doing anyway). My fiance's sister told him to shut the fuck up and the dad said ""come on now"" in a reproachful tone, and then I said ""just checking are you aware there are personality traits other than dickhead and edgelord?"", after which my fiance's mother told me off for speaking to her son like that because he's just looking out for his brother. I asked if ""I'm just meant to let him say whatever he wants, then?""

Call ended quickly after that, and now I've had messages from my future parents in law and brother in law all expecting me to apologize in order to smooth things over. Fiance says not to apologise for shit and his sister says they're ridiculous but this might be the easiest way to move on, and pointed out that I did go for him there when they'd already spoken to him.

Aita?"
3973,AmItheAsshole,AITA for keeping the shoes?,"My friend had these really, really dirty (and old ish?) Nikes that she told me she was gonna get rid of, because “cleaning them is impossible and too much work”. 

They were not too bad off, just dirty and even in my size! So me being a broke university student asked if I could have them, and she said yes, do what you want with them. I normally save all of my money, so no new shoes in a while, boy was I happy!

She gave me the shoes some days before the lockdown, so we haven’t seen eachother in about two months before this past saturday. 

I had cleaned the shoes really intense, and actually used many hours and money on it. We had a little get together with some of our friends (yes, my country is NOT in lockdown anymore, it is very controlled). 

At this get together she saw the shoes, and said “oh Thank you *my name*, you fixed up my shoes!”. At this point i thought she was joking, and said something like “yeah, they just needed a little love to shine perfectly white and bright again”. 

She then started asking why I had them on, and if I could take HER shoes off - at this point i was like ????, and told her she gave them to me, so i would not take them off. 

Most friends are on my side and are saying that because she would have dumped them in the trash and GAVE them to me, they are mine. I sure as hell think they belong to me too, because 1) she gave them to me, and 2) I spend a lot of money and time to fix them and 3) SHE GAVE THEM TO ME. 

She is accusing me of stealing them and that i was only “borrowing them”. She left quikly, and some of the others said i was kinda an asshole for not giving them back. 

AITA?

Edit: okay, it might be important, but she called my parents and told them a sob story about how i took them from her. They now know the true story, but are saying i should give them back to “maintain peace” - they are saying I am being a bad friend for keeping them. I really don’t want to give them back, OR maintain that relationship."
3974,AmItheAsshole,"AITA for refusing to walk the dogs with my family, because I hate “poop tag”?","I (25F) have been staying at home with my family for the last two months. My family wanted me to spend quarantine with them, so I have been working from my parents house since.

My mom and dad (50s), sister (12), and I have been going on daily evening walks with our two dogs - one is mine and the other our family dog. This is usually a great and enjoyable time for our family. For the last week, my dad and sister really got into a game called “Poop Tag”, it’s basically where after the dogs poop and the bag is tied they throw the dog poop bag at each other and my mom and I. 

I hate this game. I don’t like getting poop, even if it’s in a bag, thrown at me and I don’t find it funny. I told them multiple times I would not walk with them if this continued. I think they thought I was joking, because they would not stop AND added new components to this game - wave poop above my head, pretend to hit me with it with large swings.

Two days ago I refused to go on walks with them anymore and now just walk my dog alone. They’ve since apologized to me and my mom for this game and have asked me to rejoin our family walks.  I do miss our family walks and probably want to rejoin, but am still really mad about the poop tag. I want to wait it out for a couple more days to get over this. Am I being unreasonable here?"
3975,AmItheAsshole,AITA for mentally giving up on a kid?,"Okay so I am a behavioral therapist for autistic kids. And with COVID and everything going on, sessions have been moved around but haven’t stopped. I have this one kid who we will call John. John is 8 years old and very aggressive. My job with John is to help him understand simple things better like time, patience, social cues, etc. This kid had promise when I started, which was about a month before the pandemic. But as the pandemic continue, his behavior has gotten worse. Session is about 3 1/2 hours. The moment I knock on the door I can hear “I DONT WANT TO DO SESSION!” Now, why doesn’t he want to do session? Because he wants to play roblox and fortnite. That’s all he wants to do. Watch YouTube videos about those games and to play them. It takes about 30-45 minutes to get him to calm down because he doesn’t want therapy. He wants to play roblox and fortnite on his xbox. And when we take it away, he will call his mom a bitch. 

Now his poor mother, I feel so bad for her. She just wants what’s best for her kid but all he does is abuse her. She tells me that it’s okay because he doesn’t understand but I can see it’s slowly killing her. She doesn’t sleep at all because every 30 minutes or so, the kid will wake her up in the middle of the night for whatever reasons. 

Going through this with the kid every single session has started to get to me. I try my absolute best with all my kids, even my non verbals. I want to help them and make sure they are learning, but this kid. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’m still doing therapy with him and I will still do what I normally do and try to help him the best I can but deep deep down I have given up on him. I feel guilty for feeling like this. So Reddit, AITA?

Edit: to the people saying that I should drop him, I don’t pick my kids and the parents don’t get to pick the therapists, so if I were to say that I can’t help him to my company, they would have to find a replacement for him and if they couldn’t, I would have to keep him. With COVID going on right now, there is an extreme shortage in my area of therapists due to them choosing not to work. Every therapist in my company at the moment has about 5-7 kids and are working almost 12 hours a day.

Edit 2: if you guys actually read the post, I’ve only mentally given up. I still try and do my normal stuff with him like I’ve always done. The exact way my company wants me to. I’ve gotten in trouble for trying to mix things up and do different things than my company has given me. Everything I can do for him is only allowed by the insurance company, if I do anything else, I can get fired.

Edit 3: I don’t think I explained this well enough, his behavior has gotten worse since the lockdown. I have been the only non family member they have seen since the lockdown. I truly believe that this has worsened him and maybe once things start going up, he might get better, but I don’t know. 

Final Edit: after some thought and after reading everyone from YTA to NAH, I’ve decided to get professional help for myself to I can better help my kids. Thank you all."
3976,AmItheAsshole,AITA for refusing to be a host to my mom's guests?,"Despite social distancing guide lines, my mom seems to want to invite a new person over every other day. Not only that she tends to have a bad habit of asking me to take on much of the hosting responsabilities like cooking, catering, and entertaining. 

Today mom invited some of her friends and their gaggle of kids to play in the pool. She was doing most of the catering this time which was nice sense I wasn't interested in being there. this was partially because I was tired from all these social gatherings but also because I'm trying to do my own things in my room. 

They all went to the backyard so I went to my room and started setting up my art project. Minutes later mom starts calling my name. I go to see what's wrong. It turns out she's tired. She wants me to come downstairs so she can take a nap in her room. I *really* didn't want to hang out with them.

She said, *""Oh come on. you can just stay here in the living room. It's just in case they need anything. You can even bring you art stuff down here.""*

Here's the kicker: We have a macaw who is bonded to me. When other people are around she's relatively quiet but if I'm there she flips out and tries her darndest to get me to pick her up. I have ADHD. I *cannot* consentrate on my work when she's clinging to me. I just can't. I need piece and quiet.

I put my foot down and told mom that I did not want to be downstairs right now. She got really annoyed but didn't fight it any further. Moments later I heard her tell her friends that she was going to sleep on the couch instead.

Now I feel bad that I refused to help. AITA?"
3977,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling a girl my ex likes what happened during our relationship?,"This is something I’ve struggled with for a while as it happened over a year ago and I’m not sure if what I did was justified. Using an alt account for obvious reasons. I’m also not sure if this will get removed. 

I was dating this guy for just over a year in high school. Long story short for most of our relationship he did some pretty bad things to me that I hid from friends and family. I lost 20 pounds due to stress and anxiety from this relationship. 

After we were broken up I had talked to him about it to see if he realized what he had done to me. He said he did and he was sorry it happened and then begged me not to tell anyone. I had no intention of letting people know about it, just people I was close with. 

I’m trying to keep this brief but there is a lot I’m leaving out. 

One day in college I was catching up with a girl me and ex knew in high school. She asked about him and what happened and I hesitated but explained it to her. She wasn’t surprised. Apparently there was an incident during the summer before college with ex and one of her friends. I was angry he didn’t take our conversations seriously when I asked him to stop his behavior. 

There was a girl that ex had been very close to at his church for several years. (Different girl than the incident) They had always been flirting and I knew while ex and I were together that she had feelings for him. I admittedly didn’t care for her because it was evident he liked her too. My ex had expressed after breaking up that he intended on dating her when she went to college (she is a year younger than us). In this moment my heart broke for her. After all I had went through and knowing what it did to me I called this girl. I FaceTimed her and told her almost everything (leaving out most of the gory details). She sobbed and thanked me for telling her. I felt sick after it but felt like I did what I needed to. 

A few days after I got an angry text from ex saying why did I get this girl involved and it wasn’t my place to tell her. Apparently she had told her parents who were prominent in their church. Ex said he would have told her in his own time but I don’t think I believe him. She even told him that she would have preferred to hear it from him even though I had a text from her stating she was glad I told her. 

Was I TA for telling this girl? I just wanted to warn her but I think I may have overstepped especially since we were never close and I actually never really liked her but felt I needed to tell her."
3978,AmItheAsshole,WIBTA for telling my In-laws to step up as parents?,"My SO’s mom remarried. MIL and SFIL adopted a daughter (LS, now 12) when she was just a baby. However, both MIL and SFIL are very distant parents. LS isn’t neglected, all of her basic needs are met. But that’s the extent of it.

LS is a nightmare. I refused to keep babysitting about a year ago because LS would throw full on, screaming, pounding on the floor, tantrums when I’d ask her to clean up. LS refuses to drink anything that isn’t soda or coffee, and MIL and SFIL see no problem with it. LS has even been told by doctors that she needs to eat and drink better, and my MIL just says “LS doesn’t want too” or “LS doesn’t like that stuff”. 

On top of the tantrums, she’ll take things right out of your hand. And if you say anything, it’s a meltdown. She’s CONSTANTLY plugged in. If she’s not on the computer, she’s on her IPad, which she plays at full volume, and if you ask her to turn it down, you guessed it; meltdown. She has had no supervision online, and knew what sex and drugs were at 7 and has bragged about this knowledge multiple times over the years. 

LS also adds everyone on social media, especially ones that allow you to track and see exactly where your “friends” are. I’ve brought this up to my in-laws, they see nothing wrong. LS also post videos on SM of her at home and says things like “everyone come over” which is then sent to every stranger on her friends list.

Her behavior just keeps getting worse and worse, but my in-laws won’t do anything. Her tantrums are getting longer and louder, and her behaviors are worsening too. She throws things and screams, she has even started talking to the air as if it is her “viewers” and won’t engage in normal conversation. She’ll talk to the air behind you, like a camera is there, not you. 

The last straw was this last week. LS was at a friends house and was making prank calls. Somehow, she had my number (note, LS does not have a cell phone of her own) and called me. Another note, I’ve been stalked by men multiple times, so I don’t give out my number and I don’t let anyone give my number out. Getting weird messages and phone calls from an unknown number unsettled me. So I asked MIL, who was over, if she knew the #. MIL recognized the # as LS’s friend’s mom’s #. I told MIL she should discipline LS. MIL waved it off. I was raised in a pretty strict household, and something like harassing calls and messages would have gotten me picked up from where I was & taken home &punished. I understand that prank calls are harmless, but LS has been told not to give out my number before (or anyone’s number because of a similar situation).

WIBTA for talking to my inlaws about stepping up as parents? They adopted her, so it’s not like they didn’t want her. But neither one acts like a parent. I’m really worried for LS’s  future but I’m also not a parent and LS isn’t my child, so I don’t know if I’d be an AH for saying something more than what I have."
3979,AmItheAsshole,AITA for walking out of a job interview?,"Around this time last year, I was in the job hunt and was looking at tech sales positions in my area. I’d been in this career about ten years, and had been recently laid off.

I was granted an interview at a relatively large startup downtown, and after the initial phone screen, I did my research and went on site for my in-person interview.

Admittedly, I got there about 25 minutes early, which was pushing obnoxious, but nobody was at the front desk. So I signed in using the iPad, took a seat, and waited. I waited until the time of the interview, got up, looked around, and started trying to get the attention of people walking around, as nobody had acknowledged me to this point.

At 15 minutes past the interview scheduled time, a lady came into the lobby and asked what I was there for. I let her know I had an interview scheduled for 15 minutes ago. She asked me to hold on and went back into the office, and a few minutes later, came back with an agenda with materials laid out about the company. The agenda confirmed that were were supposed to have already started, and that I had two interviewers in the next two 30-minute blocks.

A new person came over and sat me in a room and told me to read over the materials to get familiar. I did this for 45 minutes, and when the VP of sales didn’t show up to interview me, I got pissed, stood up, and left. I found my way to the front desk and told the person who was not there before and had likely no idea who I was that I was ending my interview, and to have a great day.

About 15 minutes later, I got a frantic call from the recruiter saying the VP was looking for me and that they wanted to start my interview. I answered that if they weren’t willing to respect my time, then I knew all I needed to know about what working there would be like.

I told several folks this story, and it’s been a 50/50 on whether or not I did the right thing, or that I don’t know the circumstances and that I could have stuck around and at least interviewed and let them know later on. AITA?"
3980,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my MIL I will never have children?,"This one is pretty straightforward. My husband and I have been married for two years. Ever since our wedding night, my MIL has been talking about grandchildren. Nonstop. I understand she’s excited. It’s a thing mother in laws do. Whatever. Up until December, I would just shrug it off. I wasn’t ready for a baby and neither was my husband. We were happy building our careers, and - sure - having a baby was a definite long-term plan of ours, but we just weren’t ready. Not yet.

Well, in December, I found out I can’t have children. My husband and I were pretty crushed. After that, my MIL’s small remarks about “grand babies” made my heart sink. Around the new year, my husband and I asked her to (please.) stop asking and making comments about us having children because it made us uncomfortable. And she did! It was great. 

Then corona hit and, well, up until very recently, I hadn’t seen anyone but my husband in months. He and I have started to accept the fact that we may never have a biological child,  and we’ve even discussed adoption/other options at length. It’s been a process, but we’ve been communicating about it. It’s been really good for us. 

The first time I saw my MIL post-quarantine, last week, she immediately made a comment about how since my husband and I have spent so much time together, she’s bound to have a grand baby for the new year. Before I could even think, I snapped, “no, and you probably never will because I’m infertile.”

She looked crestfallen and was mortified. I didn’t mean to snap at her like that, but it just came out of me. Initially, my husband was super supportive and kept telling me that this was on her, and we had asked her to stop asking. Now, he wants ME to apologize, saying his mother keeps crying on the phone with him because she thinks I hate her. So... I have to apologize? I know what I did was abrupt. I own that. But, I don’t think I should apologize. 

Am I the asshole?"
3981,AmItheAsshole,AITA here? Quit my job and told them why,"So last week I quit my job (I got an amazing offer from an amazing company). 

My almost-former boss asked why and I told her (via email due to COVID) the complete truth: microagressions, lack of diversity (or interest in bring more in), nepotism, exclusion and subtle racism, homophobia, and sexism. I copied her bosses and sent a diversity plan to them. 

I listed examples and pasted links for how to deal with and recognize microagressions. I listed out examples of what I’ve experienced and made suggestions on how they can correct it.

This was last Friday - on my day off. They have yet to reply.

Edit: note - I’m in HR and I manage the AAP, hiring, and diversity for this company. - it’s literally my job."
3982,AmItheAsshole,AITA for asking my fiancé to choose between drinking and our family?,"Long story short, my fiancé has always been a drinker. He has a drink every night to wind down after working swing shift while he plays video games. His drink consists of a 20oz Yeti cup filled with ice. Then filled 2/3 with Jim Beam followed by Dr. Pepper. He’d typically just have the one drink about 11pm when he got home and come to bed about 2am. 

Over the last year, his drinking has gotten crazy. He now drinks 3 of those cups a night, every single night. He stays up past 4am getting wasted while playing his game and yelling the whole time. I get up for work at 5:30 am so it’s very disturbing to sleep in our bed. Many nights I sleep on the couch. After playing and drinking, he goes and wrecks my kitchen heating up food. I used to make allowances because he was still able to get up for work and he’d let me sleep in one weekend day and take care of the kids that morning. And I don’t think I really realized how much he was drinking. 

But now we’re both home, his drinking really bothers me. As I watch him fill his cup with liquor I feel repulsed. Because I know that the more he drinks, the more obnoxious and verbally abusive he becomes. Every night I’m called a bitch or a whore. And if I say anything, he says he can’t joke with me. But I don’t find it funny nor do I see how it’s a joke when I’m literally just laying there trying to sleep.

The other night I snapped. My stove was covered in queso. He had kept me up all night with his yelling and all the kitchen noise. I told him it’s us or alcohol. Previous talks asking him to slow down his drinking only made him drink more so I’m at my wits end.

His response was to say he will drink more now and maybe if I got drunk, he’d like me better. So I walked away. And I haven’t spoken to him since unless absolutely necessary. I know alcoholism is a disease and it runs in his family. I’m conflicted with wanting to be happy and feeling guilty for the ultimatum. So AITA?"
3983,AmItheAsshole,AITA for eating ice cream in front of my lactose intolerant brother?,"My 16 year old brother was diagnosed with lactose intolerance about 8 months ago, he has it fairly bad I think he can’t eat anything with lactose in it without having to leave in the bathroom for like 2 days afterward.

My mum has bought lactose free and vegan food to accommodate him while trying to not majorly change his diet. One sore spot for him is ice cream, he has vegan friendly ice cream in our freezer but claims it doesn’t taste the same. I’ve got no clue, I don’t eat it because I don’t want to limit the amount of food he can eat in the house.

So because of the recent hot weather where I live mums been getting more ice cream when she does the shopping. She buys a tub for each of us so there isn’t an issue with sharing ( she’s always done this I think it comes from being 1 of 8 kids growing up and sharing being difficult). 

It was the afternoon and the temperature was at its peak so without really thinking about it I went and got my ice cream out and was sat on the sofa eating it, my brother comes down sees me and almost immediately starts shouting while demanding to know what I’m eating. I told him it was cookie dough ice cream and he wanted to know if it was suitable for him, I responded no because it wasn’t and he had a tube of chocolate in the freezer that he could eat.

He started shouting about how he is always left out and disrespected for being different, that he’s always bought shit ice cream and that if he has to make do with vegan ice cream everyone else should too, he then stormed up the stairs and slammed his bedroom door as hard as he could. 

Mum and dad have opted to ignore it, they’re putting it down to a stress reaction, he’s asked me to apologise to him because he feels I was inconsiderate of his issues. I don’t think I need to apologise, he’s been offered pills that could help him eat lactose foods but refused them and he has got food options. Why do I have to change my diet for him or my eating habits for him?

So AITA?"
3984,AmItheAsshole,AITA for refusing to pay the full car payment and removing my dad’s access from my bank account?,"Background: 
My brother (20M) and I (23F)share a car. Sucks but he invested in it ($700 worth from one car traded in for a few thousand to get current car) and my dad got the lease under his own name. 

We’ve been making payments of $250 for 3 years and are about 11 months from paying it off. 

I was upset that I didn’t have a car while in college and now had to share one. I would’ve been able to save for my own if allowed to work in high school but I wasn’t allowed where my brother was. It’s whatever I’m not gonna complain about having a car 50% of the time. 

I have always made every payment on time to my dad. He has access to my account so he’d just take $250 for the car payment and my insurance each month. 

My brother his freshman year of college was so irresponsible and refused to work his work study job or search for another campus job. He then proceeded to refuse to eat dining hall food and leech off me guilting next starting at 8pm when the dining halls closed to not only get him food but pick it up for him and drop it off most days. 

During this time he was broke constantly and didn’t pay my dad a car payment for the entire school year. 

**current**

My brother and I now switch off weeks with the car since we don’t live together. When I have the car, my boyfriend drives it too but he’s usually either with me doing something together or running errands with me I could’ve done alone. There have been very few times he’s used the car for his own reasons. 

My brother doesn’t have a job. 
I just landed a salaried position. 
My boyfriend is working on getting a job. 

My dad (since my boyfriend has used the car) is now insisting that my boyfriend and I pay the entire payment. The full $500 since my dad “has been so cool with bf using it.” I know my dad has been pulling this shit because he is running low on funds too. 

WIBTA if I refused to pay this full amount?

I currently am waiting to start getting paid and until then have $30 to my name? I am hoping to get my stimulus check in the mail soon as well. So I plan on removing my dad from my account so he can’t just go in and take the money.

TLDR: just got a new job, brother doesn’t have one. Brother And I share the car. My boyfriend periodically uses my car. Because of this my dad wants me to pay the full car payment. I want to remove my dad from my checking account when I start getting paid to prevent this."
3985,AmItheAsshole,AITA for canceling my girlfriend's Blue Apron subscription?,"So my girlfriend and I have been living together for a few months now, and in that time she has become really reliant on her Blue Apron subscription for most of our meals. I have told her multiple times that I don't like the food - it's not my style and I would prefer not to eat it, but I've forced myself several times to be polite. She's basically told me that it's not my choice what she chooses to eat, but she neglects to realize that even though it's her home, we're both living there now and sacrifices need to be made on both ends. I put up with her disgusting box of food for a few weeks, but I reached a point where I couldn't take it anymore, and frankly I was off-put by her laziness and reluctance to actually cook a meal. I took it upon myself to log onto her laptop and cancel the subscription - keep in mind, this was a decision that affected both of us, and she hasn't really seemed to care much for what I want. She assumed it was a technical error for a while until I informed her what I did, which sent her into total hysterics. I'm honestly tired of hearing her complain and I'm tired of her laziness, especially in a time when she's not the only person in the house. Would you guys agree that I was at least justified to cancel the Blue Apron subscription, considering the circumstances?

**TL;DR: Canceled my girlfriend's food box subscription because she was being lazy about cooking and I don't like the meals, she hasn't been accommodating to me at all about it.**"
3986,AmItheAsshole,AITA for threatening to kick my sister and her children out during a global pandemic?,"My (20F) sister (30F) has two kids (5F and 7M) She recently divorced her husband and is temporarily staying with me because she has nowhere else to go. She could move in with our parents but for some reason, she decided to stay with me for a few days. Few days turned into months because of the pandemic and so, here we are.

I honestly don't mind. I love her, and I love the kids. What I can't stand is her behaviour. Bear with me. This is going to sound very bizarre. 

My sister is very religious. She has a facebook group, whatsapp group and an instagram where she has about 5000 followers. She's probably also on reddit and many other social media.

Usually, she's nice and sweet, but lately, she's become somewhat crazy. She has these “sessions” with her kids every few days. These “sessions” last about half an hour. During these sessions, she teaches her kids about the LGBTQ community. Not good things, but she teaches them about how being gay is a sin and all of that. Being Transgender is a disease. How to avoid getting infected etc. She tells them to repeat words after her, and then makes a video and uploads it everywhere.

It's very very bizarre. She gets a lot of likes on social media where like-minded people praise her and upload similar videos of them having these “sessions” with their kids. She's part of this group trying to “lead the new generation to the right path” Her little daughter who is five has the sentences memorized. “Being gay is a sin. You will burn in hell” is her answer if you ask her “What do you think about gay people?”

The problem is I'm bisexual. My sister conveniently forgets that. “No, you're not. You'll get over it when you meet the right person” is what she tells me when I mention it.

This is my house. I will not tolerate her disrespecting me in my own home. I told her that as long as she stays in my home, eats my food, uses my things, she's not allowed to have these “sessions” in my living room. This led to a massive argument where she bragged about her followers, refused to listen to me, insulted me and refused to apologize. 

I ended up threatening her. I told her she can't live here if she behaves this way which made her cry. Now I'm the heartless, selfish asshole in my family who threatened to kick her poor divorced sister and her little kids out in the middle of a global pandemic. I would obviously never do that to her. I only wanted her to stop being homophobic. Besides, she can always go to our parents.

I have apologized countless times, even to my parents, but I'm being repeatedly called heartless. Am I the asshole for wanting my sister to stop being homophobic? Am I the asshole for threatening her to get her to stop?"
3987,AmItheAsshole,AITA for refusing to do free labor for family?,"Okay, so backstory... I have an aunt who has two girls (16 & 9) my aunt doesn’t know how or care to learn how to do hair. I learned how to do my own hair when I was younger, so I’m fairly good at braiding, etc. 

However, being a hairstylist is not my ambition. I actually hate doing hair, but because they had no one else to do their hair.. I did it for them, didn’t ask for anything in return. The free hairstyles went on for about 2 months.. 

When I started getting short on cash, and realized she was bringing them by my house almost every week to get their hair done.. (retwist for the older girls whole head, and the younger usually wanted some style she’d seen on Instagram) I told her that I’d like to start getting paid $20 per head. Which isn’t bad considering that the process to do both heads usually took me all day. 

She got upset and refused, started talking about all the things she’d done for me.. which only included a few rides to work (which she was compensated for) & she started taking her girls to a hair salon, paying way more than what I asked for. When I questioned the logic, she said if she was going to pay for her kids hair to be done it was going to be professionally. Okay, no problem.. I hate doing hair anyway. 

So, now that COVID has shut down most businesses.. she had my mom reach out to me asking me to do the girls hair. Again, I said I would but it will be $20 per head. I don’t feel like I’m in the wrong, she has the funds.. she just doesn’t feel like she should have to pay me. My mom, and other aunts have been texting me about the value of family and being there for one another, calling me selfish, etc... but considering I’m out of work and barely making it.. I don’t think I’m the one being selfish.. thoughts? 

LSDR; Aunt doesn’t feel the need to pay me to do her kids hair, but will pay professionals for 3x my asking price!"
3988,AmItheAsshole,AITA for misusing quarantine rules?,"This happened some weeks ago when I was working at a quarantine ward of one of the local hospitals (Freelance RN). Didn't think much of it until today. It'll become a case study before the local ethics board (I'm invited since it's about my decision, got the mail today).

As mentioned, I worked at the quarantine ward of a hospital when I got a new patient (let's call her Sally). No initial diagnosis, only some symptoms that may or may not be related to the actual pandemic. Took her in, explained everything and did my initial anamnesis. Turned out she's 17 and her parents didn't know she went to the hospital (complicated family history). Told her it's ok, but if they call and ask I'd have to tell them that she's with us. She agreed but didn't want me to tell anyone why she's in the hospital. Again, I told her that's ok and we'll respect that. 

Time went by, nobody called, all tests came back negative and the diagnosis was an endometriosis with panic attacks. Obviously, the one that really scares the shit out of you.

That day we got a call from her mom. She wanted to know why her daughter is in the hospital, why she wasn't informed about that and why her daughter doesn't really answer her phone. Seems she texted her and all that Sally wrote back was something like ""It's fine, fuck off"". Told her that Sally is my patient but that I'm not allowed to give her any info about her medical status, especially not on the phone (could be anyone calling). So she told me she'd come to the hospital. And I replied that this wouldn't be a good idea due to the whole pandemic thing and the hospital lockdowns. She insisted, so I didn't try to change her decision. Told Sally about her mom's plans and the first thing she said was that she didn't want to see her. Twice. It would have been enough that way, but hospital regulations allowed visits in extreme and/or special circumstances.

The inevitable happened: Mom arrived at the hospital, security denied entry, mom demanded to talk to the responsible Dr., they had a short discussion and then the Doc came to me because of the issue at hand: Mom wanted to see her daughter. We went both to Sally, told her about the situation and she refused to see her mom. Doc didn't really have a say when it came to visits, that was my responsibility and decision. Reminded me that this absolutely qualified for the ""special circumstances"". And I decided against the mother, respecting the repeated wishes of my patient. Went to mom, told her about the decision. 

Sally was happy, mom was raging. Seems she wrote a massive complaint (the reason for the case study). 

Tl;dr: Minor was my patient, didn't want to see her mom, I didn't let mom in using quarantine regulations.

P.S.: Before anyone tries to explain the law to me because she was a minor, please don't. I'm not in the US and I know my local laws. They were on the patients side and supported my decision"
3989,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling husband with a migraine to sleep on the couch?,"So, the husband suffers from migraines. He gets one every three or four months. But they’re pretty debilitating. The kids and I are extra quiet and leave him alone to sleep for hours or until the next day when he has one. That’s fine, I’ll hold down the fort. Usually by the time I go to bed, he will have made the room uninhabitable for me. The a/c will either be set extremely cold or heat on high and he’s wrapped himself in all the bedding. Like a cocoon. There won’t be anything left for me to use except the scratchy spare blanket. If I make any noise or turn on any lights  getting to bed or sleeping, he snaps at me. Usually by that point he goes to sleep in the living room, snapping at me that I should be the one to sleep on the couch. 
Today he had a migraine and has been out of it since noon. I’ve dealt with the kids alone, including the newborn baby. I’ve brought him food and medications and whatever else he needed. Finally I got the other kids to bed and
I was exhausted. I told him to get up and get his stuff and to sleep on the couch. He started protesting and said to just grab my own stuff to sleep on the couch...but there’s literally nowhere safe for me to put the baby to sleep. Her crib is in our room, next to my side. We don’t have a bassinet and besides, she sleeps really well in her own crib. She’s still way too young to be alone in her room and she’s breastfeeding. It doesn’t make sense for me to have to sleep on the couch away from her. 
I feel really sympathetic that he’s going through this, I know it’s really painful and knocks him out. I really do everything I can to make him more comfortable during the day and before bedtime, but AITA for telling him to sleep on the couch while he has one? 
BTW it’s a pullout couch with an upgraded mattress. It’s pretty comfortable but definitely not safe to cosleep with baby.


Edit- I’ve been asked to edit the post with this information. I apologize I thought it was self explanatory. The crib in which the baby sleeps in is a large, wrought iron type metal crib. It can’t be picked up let alone wheeled or lifted. It took over two hours to put together. I don’t currently have a portable crib or pack and play type thing that is safe for sleep."
3990,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my friend the joke she sent me wasn’t funny?,"Kinda short, but we were just snapping and she sent me a “meme” if you want to call it that, but it was basically a picture of a dead guy lying in the ground with blood everywhere from a school shooting. It had Fortnite loot all around him 

I don’t really find shit like that to be really funny so I just responded with the emoji “😐”

She responded with “I love it when friends can’t take jokes”

Then I said that “I knew it was a joke but it just wasn’t funny to me lol” 

Then she just left me on opened lmao"
3991,AmItheAsshole,AITA for calling my friend a deadbeat?,"This is a throwaway account because anytime my ex is mentioned anywhere, he threatens to sue me.

I am a 26 year old woman. Friend is a 27 year old man. We are both parents. Me to a 5 year old, him to a 7 year old, 5 year old, 4 year old, a 1 year old then 2 step kids. We live vastly different lives when it comes to parenting. I am a single mom and have been doing it without help for 2 years. He is a stay at home dad to his 1 year old and step kids. He hasnt seen his older 3 in 4 years. He doesnt even try to. He never even mentions his older kids.

We were playing online last night and talking about our kids when I mentioned that I saw his 2 oldest at the store the other day and how big they've gotten. He started going on a rant about evil women and how dare his kids mom keep them from him. I asked him if he had thought about taking her to court to demand visitation because his kids need him. He got angry and told me it wouldnt matter because he doesnt pay child support so it wouldnt happen. I tried to tell him child support and custody are two completely different issues.

He lost it on me. He told me how would I know because I ""keep my son away from his father""(I dont, hes refused all contact) and I'm probably making bank off of support(I dont because he doesnt pay it). He called me one of those shitty moms who has no right to say crap to a loving father.

I'll be honest, I didnt keep my cool. I told him it must be real nice to get to choose to be a dead beat and if he gave half a damn, he would try to do anything for his kids. That he couldnt complain about ""evil women"" when he wont put in the effort. I logged out. 

Now I feel like a major asshole to him because even if hes my oldest friend, it wasnt my place. Our other close friend said that he needed to hear it because he cant keep whining about it.

So reddit. Was I the asshole here?"
3992,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my ex best friend to stop texting me about my dead daughter?,"my six year old daughter died a couple months ago and the mourning process is already difficult enough. my ex-best friend keeps texting me about my daughter and he says things such as “it’s a damn shame” and he’s in “pain” but he never even met my daughter! it’s tearing me to pieces so i blocked him! a bunch of our mutual friends say i’m being insensitive but i’m the one who lost my child. AITA?

EDIT: please stop asking me why he didn’t meet my kid. not everyone likes children. the whole situation was difficult and awful. i really regret posting this because now I’m the one who has given myself continuous reminders. every notification from this post is making this feel worse at this point in time. thank you all for the help but i’m no longer engaging with this post"
3993,AmItheAsshole,AITA for lashing out at my friends to back off and not comment on my unconventional personal life?,"Firstly, let me clarify that this is not a click bait , validation post and neither do I have anger issues. My therapist has verified that. 

I came here because I feel lost and looking for an honest answer. I actually do feel like an asshole. I am in an ldr with a man from another country. Why? Because I come from a culture where women like me are not appreciated and options are next to none. I also have liberal values means it is impossible for me to be with someone local. I legit like this person and I don't want to lose him. We were best friends for few years lbefore we got together. Yes, there are risks in such an arrangement. Not denying that. But I am a consenting adult woman after all and I'm making an informed choice.. I accept the risks along with it.. 


Now the friends I have made over the years say nasty things to me like "" I don't have my shit together"" and "" They are concerned about me"" and that ""long distances never work"" And other have accused me of ""having a low self esteem"" And ""I'm being immature"" 

I have defended myself initially by saying ""there are no guaratees that local stuff work out as well"" And ""it is my choice after all"" But they won't back off..

After a while when they didn't back off I lashed out at them hard saying ""stay tf away from. My personal life. You don't get a right to decide and mind your own business."" I finally got tired and said "" I am breaking my friendship with all of you"" 

And I severed ties with them all. They are now blaming me that they were being caring but i lashed out and that had upsetted them. Am I the asshole here?."
3994,AmItheAsshole,AITA for contemplating calling CPS on my next door neighbor for neglect?,"Our neighbors next door are a single mom, her mom, and her 6 year old son. Everyday he sits at a chair looking through our chain link fence for hours. He watches my kids play and I usually tell him he can come play in our backyard and eat over for lunch and dinner. I know his mom works full time but I rarely see anyone come and check on him. He never wants to go home.

Also, for his age he talks about a lot of inappropriate things. He tries to convince my 7 year old daughter to sneak out in the middle of the night with him and to keep it a secret from me and my husband. He also tries to kiss her a lot (which I know is normal for kids to do but combined with the talk about sneaking out it concerns me). There have also been a few occasions where he has physically hurt my 2 year old son on purpose. 

For extra context he has good hygiene, clean clothes, and seems to be fed. 

Am I being an asshole and overreacting? I don’t want to ruin a family over nothing. I just want to do the right thing for the child."
3995,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not letting the kids I nanny create fake words in Scrabble?,"I (F22) babysit fairly often as an extra source of income, and recently I’ve been nannying for a family with kids who are stuck at home while the parents both have essential jobs to go to.  There are 2 kids, a 10 year old boy and an 8 year old girl.  Before the pandemic this was a family I babysat for every now and then over the course of maybe a year, but since the schools closed down I’ve been a daytime nanny for them 2-3 times a week.

Recently I took it upon myself to play educational games with the kids in order to keep their brains sharp.  While they still had homework assigned that I would sit down and help them with, I thought that since it was considered “school hours” I would keep things as educational as I could while I was with them.  Recently one of the games I played with them was Scrabble, one of their favorites.  A classic game about making words with the letters you have available.  A perfect example of a game you can easily make educational and fun.

Only one problem:  the kids were having more fun making up fake words than spelling out real ones. I was patient with them at first and tried my best to set a good example by spelling out real words myself when my turns came.  However they wouldn’t stop goofing off and would keep making up new animal names and foods instead of creating real words.  I eventually got annoyed enough to give up and end the game and took it away from them, and told them if they weren’t going to take it seriously they weren’t allowed to play.  This made them really upset but I stood my ground and told them no, and had them start a new activity.

The next day when I arrived in the morning, before the mom left, she pulled me aside to talk to me in private.  It turns out the kids complained to their mom about my strict scrabble rules and how I took it away from them.  The mom didn’t seem mad, and just simply said it’s ok if they play it the way they want.  I didn’t fight her on this and said ok.

Eventually the kids asked if we could play scrabble and.... I told them no.  Just because they were allowed to play it however they wanted to didn’t mean they were allowed to play it WHENever they wanted to, specifically when I was with them during education hours.  They got upset but I still told them no, and eventually had to put them into time out.  When they finally calmed down I got them distracted with a different game instead.

Since then, I’ve been only asked to nanny 1-2 times a week instead of the usual 3-4.  I can’t help but wonder if my strictness around scrabble has anything to do with it.  But like come on... it’s just scrabble. Am I really such a mean nanny for discouraging them from making up words?  AITA?

EDIT:

I feel the need to add that the parents hired me to do educational activities with the kids, including homework and educational games.  While I’m trying to of course make things fun for the kids, keeping their learning intact is a high priority for me as well as their parents. There were a number of different educational games I played with them that they liked, but scrabble is the one they wouldn’t take seriously.   And yes, they are allowed to play it however they want when I’m not around, however when I’m with them the focus needs to be on activities they can actually benefit from, not spelling out nonsense words."
3996,AmItheAsshole,AITA for giving my parents a piece of their own medicine?,"So me and my parents have an awry relationship and because of universities shutting down I have to live with them. Anyway, I make sure to contribute and keep to my self but my parents have always been ones comment on my weight and the weight of others incessantly. 

To the point I have developed an eating disorder that I had to take matters into my own hands to unlearn all that nonsense. I’m home and I want to enjoy things I was able to afford to have the time to eat in college like pizza, so whenever I want to enjoy these things I’m instantly reminded I’m ruining my progress or they’ll make fun of other people to make me feel ashamed. 

Not only that but whenever I decline having pizza or anything else, they compliment me and say good job or you have so much willpower. 

I finally had enough because I have asked, I have sat down, I have tried my best having one on one conversations with them but they do not understand where their words are causing harm towards me. 

Finally I had enough and decide to make comments back, I noticed that the dishes was full in the kitchen sink and jammed pack to the point you couldn’t fill a pot and while I was doing them, my mother was passing by and I told her if she wouldn’t constantly make all these large portions she’d lose weight. 

Then I told my Dad shouldn’t have an entire pizza because he did 2 hours of outside work. 

I also told my mother that she shouldn’t put cake with every celebration just because Memorial Day was yesterday.

They all were shocked and upset that I would say things like that and told me to cut it out and then we started this argument about how suddenly it’s okay to treat me like this but if I do it back it’s practically bullying. I told my boyfriend and he said he thinks it’s a soft ESH and I was little more of asshole than they were but I feel like that’s downplaying how I feel and how I have an eating disorder. AITA?

Also just so you know I’m a little below average in weight and my parents are both overweight but not obese."
3997,AmItheAsshole,AITA for refusing to try and fix my relationship with my friend after they started to date my ex?,"I (23F) dated my ex (28M) for 5 years 

Our relationship was healthy and fun at first, I then got pregnant and things went to hell, he stopped working so I was going to school and working so I could pay our expenses, he was extremely controlling and jealous- our relationship was unhealthy, we broke up and he came out as gay.

We co parent just fine but that’s it, I can’t move past what he did.

I’ve been friends with K (24M) for 9 years.

We haven’t seen or really spoken since March, which was weird since we’re usually close.

He posted a picture of himself and my ex kissing, when I asked he said they’d been dating for 2 years, I’ve only been split from my ex for a year, he wanted to wait to tell me, he doesn’t want agro with me since now we’ll be co parents! (It didn’t all happen this fast but I’m trying to sum it up) 

I told him I could remain neutral towards him in front of my daughter but that’s it, he’s been spamming me either apologising or saying he deserves happiness after dealing with his homophobic parents for so long, my ex deserves happiness and I can’t control who they date etc.

Apparently he’s ignoring our friends because he’s “devastated” over our friendship ending.

My friends are really torn, some say I’m the AH for trying to control his happiness and some agree that my ex shouldn’t have even been an option in his eyes, all want me to fix my friendship with him.

AITA?"
3998,AmItheAsshole,AITA for leaving an honest review for my friends business?,"
A long distance friend of mine recently started a business. She makes candles that are supposed to be burned to offer good health, protection, fortune, love, etc. She lost her job and invested most of her money in starting up this business. She has been asking other friends and me to support/promote her. 

Although I think the timing of the business and what it promotes is a little bit slimy, I tried to be a supportive friend. I understand her backstory, and hope that this is something she actually believes. I ordered a couple of candles from her. The two candles costed $30. 

I really love candles, essential oils, incense and the like. These candles were disappointing. I gave them 3/5 stars. I won’t post the whole review here due to lack of space, but I can share it if asked. 

I Posted the review, and some pictures of the candles on my IG, they were very pretty, and I thought that was good enough. 

I got a text from my friend expressing disappointment in my review. I told her that I liked the candle OK and left an honest review. I tried to support her so I didn’t understand the problem. She told me she was really depending on her network to help her start the foundation of the business, and she was really counting on her friends to leave her good reviews rather than reviews that may cost her. 

I got annoyed because I felt that she was being demanding and dishonest. I told her that if she wanted a better review that she should supply a better product. That made her upset, and she told me that her candles weren’t glade candles,they were to fulfill a purpose. I already had the thought that she was exploiting people, and I told her that if she was going to scam people she could at least make it smell good. 

She ended up posting our messages, and calling me out in front of several of our mutual friends for accusing her of being a charlatan. A couple of people have reached out to me and asked me why I went about this the way I did. One of my friends in particular says that if I didn’t like the candle I shouldn’t have posted a review, and that I was an asshole for that. I should have left it at an Instagram post only saying good things about the products. I was thinking that maybe it was best to be honest, but now I’m wondering if I missed something socially and I’m an asshole for posting the review. AITA?"
3999,AmItheAsshole,Aita for telling my sister she needs to stop living through her kids?,"So when my older sister was younger, she was an avid dancer. My mother enrolled her in ballet classes since she could walk and she was a protege. I remember doing ballet as a child but wasn’t even a fraction as good as her. I quit when I was six, she continued and began competing competitively very young and dance became her life.


She did it five days a week every week for years, competing in between. She got into an amazing dance school on scholarship, and even made into one of the biggest ballet associations in America. Unfortunately she got into a really bad car accident in her mid twenties and broke many bones. She would never be able to dance again. 


My sister fell into extreme depression after this. Dance was her life since she had her first memories and now she would be dropped from her job and have to restart over in life. That was decades ago. We both now are in our fourties and have kids of our own.


My sister has three kids, two daughters and a son. She enrolled her daughters into ballet when they were babies. Didn’t think much of it, many parents that were dancers do. When she pulled them out of school (elementary) so they could do dance full term, I was a bit worried. She claimed she was homeschooling them but was at the studio 24/7.


Her daughters would either be traveling studying dance with top instructors around the world (She married very wealthy), working on material for new competitions, and attending summer school for ballet. Their entire lives involved around the sport while her husband stayed home with their son, they would be out and about. 

I never really had any concerns since I thought the kids loved it and were just as enthusiastic. They are now 12 and 14. Since quarantine and everything’s come to a halt, they can only dance in their home studio. Their mother makes them still get up every morning at 7 and dance till 1, break for lunch, then dance till 6 then end for the day. 


I overheard my niece complaining to my daughter on FaceTime about this. She kept going on and said she and her little sister asked her mom if they can go to regular school and stop dance many times over the years and their mom says no! From what my sister paints, they love dance and are the ones begging to make it their entire life. 


I admittedly spoke to my sister about this. I told her if her daughters want to drop ballet or just do it once every week, they should. And if they want to stop home schooling they should too. They can’t live her dream of becoming pros for her. She went off and told me to not parent her or her kids and that they only complain very rarely when they lose a competition or get bad feedback from a instructor. Aita?"
4000,AmItheAsshole,AITA for baking and eating a whole cake?,"Super silly but it’s caused a massive fight! So I (21F) graduated university last week, obviously there is no ceremony but I worked hard for years to get where I am and I was super proud. I wanted to do something to celebrate, so I decided to bake myself a cake. 

I asked my partner (25M), and my mother in law (53F) who is staying with us, if they had any preferences as to what type of cake I should make. They said no, partner said it was a waste of money and he wouldn’t pay for it, we should save our money for other things etc. I genuinely felt like I deserved this for working so hard so I went out and bought all the ingredients myself and made the cake on Wednesday afternoon. 

Cut to today, it’s been nearly a week and the small cake I baked as been eaten, I must say entirely by me but I did give a tiny tiny bit of sponge to my dog and some to my sister. 

My partner and mother in law decided to sit outside in the garden and day drink, since 11am, they called me out and asked for some cake, mother in law specifically wanted a “nice big slice of chocolate” I didn’t make chocolate. I told them there was none of the vanilla cake I made left and that they didn’t want any. I said there was some chocolate in the fridge she could have or I’d happy make her a sandwich or some pancakes if she was hungry. She lost her ever loving shit. Completely lost it. 

She started yelling and screaming I was selfish, how dare I not make a chocolate cake knowing that’s her favourite (I didn’t), she called me some horrible names, commenting on my weight for eating most of it etc. Now I’m not super thin, but I’m not fat either but I do have some issues with my weight and she did make me cry. 

Mother in law says I’m a selfish fat bitch, she said I’m useless and how can she trust me to care for her son if she cannot trust me to keep her some cake. She also said that I shouldn’t be celebrating graduating, she would only celebrate when I become a “proper wife” and I need to focus on her sons needs more instead of school. I said the cake was a week old, it needed to be eaten fast as it had fresh buttercream and fruit and even if there was some left, it wouldn’t have kept and she said she didn’t want any, it was a waste of money etc. Boyfriend said nothing. 

I’m now alone in my bedroom listening to her outside still yelling about me wondering if I really am the asshole? Should I have kept her some or should I have pushed a bit more to ask for their preferences instead of just accepting their first answer? 

TLTR; baked a cake a week ago, cake has now been eaten and a week later MIL wanted some. I said there was none left and she lost her shit basically.

EDIT; hi everyone, thank you so much for your comments! I’m trying my best to read them all, but I am definitely reevaluating my relationship. 

And to answer the question about the living situation, they are both staying with me. MIL came over for dinner, wanted to stay the night and basically never left, it’s been 9 months! I have tried to ask her to leave but I have autism and my communication isn’t great so she never takes me seriously! But I think it’s time to do something, thank you"

4102,unpopularopinion,People over 65 shouldn't get to run a country,"Trying to imagine my own grandfather running the country with the same ideals and standards and slightly outdated views that he picked up from his years in college and graduate school in the 1960's would be an absolute disaster. He's an intelligent and progressive man, and was very valuable in his field for years, but soon became very disconnected from the direction the world was moving... eventually you just run out of steam, or become impatient with things and find it harder to learn new skills and adapt to new ways of thinking.

Seeing Scandinavian countries with leaders who are younger and more in tune with the changes in society, and the different challenges current youth and young adults are facing economically is incredibly valuable. They seem to have an energy and drive to progress forward and it is so much more refreshing than watching these heavily aged candidates try and rally the country together in an effort to tie up their legacy before they die.

Edit: this was fun but I’m checking out now, gotta make dinner. I’m glad this provoked some controversy and conversation."
4103,unpopularopinion,Kobe Bryant's death was tragic but has no right to be next to the worst events of 2020,"Alright, I get it. His death was tragic and was a loss to many people he influenced, But people still seem to be blowing it out of proportion. People made it seem like the world was ending and put more weight on his death then the Coronavirus reaching america back in January. I am also sick of only hearing his name when 8 other people died including his daughter. His death was tragic and untimely but it is in no way comparable to hundreds of thousands dying to Covid-19, Millions of people losing their jobs, the fires in Australia or any other thing that is happening in the world. There is so much crazy stuff happening that it does a disservice to say he had any part in the world running shit first into a fan. 

Speaking of fans, I get it, But Kobe is objectively not the best basketball player. I will link another post in the comments of him being overrated. However, my main point is that even if was the greatest player ever, we still lost more to sports as a whole from everything being closed now. 

I again would like to state that this is my opinion and I just am really surprised that people are still talking about him like he was some infallible legend. 

Please remember, HE WAS ONE PERSON."
4104,unpopularopinion,Your average Joe doesn't have to reduce his carbon footprint and aid against climate change until big corporations and governments start trying.,"Pretty much, the average person's attempts to minimize their effect on climate change is a very valiant cause, but will do nothing in the long-run until corporations and governments own up to their shortcomings and do something about it. Governments burning fossil fuels and corporations dumping trash into the oceans and not doing anything to reduce their carbon footprints is going to be the last straw for humans. If we continue like this, then climate change is in my opinion going to be the one that kills a majority of the population. The quote, ""A chain is only as strong as its weakest link"" really applies here. It's great that people do their bit in helping, but until governments and companies do something, the world will continue in the downward spiral that it's on. Until governments start use renewable energy instead of coal or corporations reduce their carbon footprint, you or I don't have to do anything because our small contribution won't really change anything.

Yeah, a person taking a shorter shower and riding a bike is for a great cause and should be supported, but it means close to nothing. Big businesses and governments have to own up and need to make huge efforts to remedy climate change.

Edit: So I see a lot of people saying that the Average Joe's job is to vote for candidates that have a policy like that. I absolutely agree! You guys have actually changed my opinion a little, but I still think that it should be the government/potential candidate and corporations that take the initiative. I know that is a bit of wishful thinking because that's putting a lot of faith in people where this isn't a priority, but the initiative is really key here in my opinion."
4105,unpopularopinion,The most abusive parents are usually the ones that look perfect to outsiders and neighbors.,"I don't know how common this phenomena is but from my experience the parents who raise the most damaged children are usually the ones who everyone loves and look up to as model parents.

They provide anything material the children need, they have a solid and good life plan for them and help them with everything they need. They seem to have time to attend to everything their children participates in and are very sociable and friendly to fellow parents in any social event."
4106,unpopularopinion,"If your cat looks like it swallowed a bowling ball and is obviously chonk, it is NOT cute. It is irresponsible and should be considered animal abuse.","I  am getting so tired of seeing posts promoting or celebrating significant chonk in pets. Being that large shortens your pets life and dramatically reduces  its quality of life. It can lead to bone, muscle and digestive problems than can cause your animal chronic pain.

Your pet cannot choose its diet, so if you overfeed you are forcing it to face these consequences. On the other side of the coin, if you never  play with your cat or walk your dog and it falls into a sedentary  lifestyle and gets that big...that’s also on you.

Not trying shame thic boi's, I just want all pets to be happy and healthy and live a great fucking life."
4107,unpopularopinion,It’s OK to say you are a fan of a band even if you just like a few of their most famous songs.,"I don’t get why people have such a problem with ‘posers’ or ‘annoying fans’.

They are still fans. They still like the same stuff you do. They are still supporting your favorite artist.

Music is music, enjoy it for what it is."
4108,unpopularopinion,Homework does more harm to high schoolers than good (read full post),"Kids do an average of 2-3.5 hours of homework a day according to multiple studies [like this one](https://mobile.edweek.org/c.jsp?cid=25920011&item=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.edweek.org%2Fv1%2Fblog%2F159%2Findex.html%3Fuuid%3D37844), [this one](https://www.statisticbrain.com/highschool-homework-statistics/), [and this one](https://www.princetonreview.com/press/student-life-american-teens). School also lasts about 7 hours, which means the average student has a workday of 9-10 hours, longer than the working adults already high ([and wasteful](https://www.inc.com/melanie-curtin/in-an-8-hour-day-the-average-worker-is-productive-for-this-many-hours.html)) 8.8 hour workday. Homework obviously helps students do better on tests, but any good homework assignment should be able to accomplish that in 15 minutes, and should only be given when needed. This makes a student work a lot less on homework (45 minutes to 90 minutes usually based on the amount of classes that assign homework) which is a good thing as now students still have the choice to study and get the full three hour benefit, work on hobbies or sports, and maybe get 8 hours of sleep. My last point was hard to fit in, as it is very unrelated, but homework on the weekends, especially 3 or more hours, is teaching our kids that their jobs should extend to the weekend. This may make kids more likely to allow their future jobs to give them work when it should be their time off. I am assuming this opinion is unpopular, especially since it is very hard to explain to anybody as a high schooler, as they just think I’m complaining and shut me out.

(Edited for spelling errors, comment if you see any more)"
4109,unpopularopinion,Tripping Kids as they run around the restaurant should be made legal,Get tired of kids running around being rowdy as hell when its a restaurant and not a playground alongside inconsiderate parents who just let it happen. You are here to eat not run in the way of the waiters trying to bring the food to the customers. You parents gotta start smacking your kids for this if telling them to not do it once isn't enough.
4110,unpopularopinion,r/fragilewhiteredditor is filled with racists who are just as bad as the people they call out and are equally fragile,"That sub is the most ironic thing to ever exist. They took sub names like r/fragileblackredditor and r/fragilefemaleredditor and made them redirects for their own sub, proving the double standard that if the same things they do were done to another race, there would be riots. Another example is it getting to stay up, but r/fragilejewishredditor did not.

The entire sub consists of cherrypicking comments and posts to make anyone white look like a Confederate soldier, not making or enforcing any effort to censor names for the sake of privacy, and exposing that user to endless messages and comments filled with racial slurs. I made it onto there for posting an unpopular opinion in **THIS SUB** (shocker, I know) and spent the next 24 hours being called cracker and mayo, and getting messages telling me that Europe should be nuked. Yet somehow the fragile one is me.

Subs like this just make the racial divide they hate so much even stronger; they don't actually give a damn about stopping racism, they just want excuses to do it themselves. Anyone who uses those hate subs should not be taken seriously"
4111,unpopularopinion,Doing badly in school shouldn't reflect your abilities as an adult.,"Yes, this is an experience of mine. A lot of people will argue differently because it's an ""unpopular opinion"" obviously. I have built up years of experience and knowledge in order to gain a position at a company I know I can do well in, however they discovered that I failed Maths 16 years ago therefore I cannot progress. I have enrolled on a course to improve this even though I passed 5 interview stages out of 10 people. Am I wrong? It's like the everything I have built up over the past 16 years has no value. Maybe I am not seeing this from a perspective I should be, if that's the case. Then sorry for being a dick."
4112,unpopularopinion,"I'm getting sick of Japanese media (games, anime, etc.) being so horny all the time.","Let me preface this by stating that I am not anti-porn or anti-sexuality. I just feel like, compared to western media, most Japanese games and anime have this layer of horniness spread over it that detracts from the actual value of the product.

I'm not saying that I don't want sex in my video games. I think when it's in games like The Witcher 3, where there's a very distinct switch from Serious Time to Sexy Time and most characters are dressed sensibly for their character and personality, it's no issue. (monsters being topless being one example that I think actually reinforces my idea) 

In contrast, Japanese games (and anime) are stuck in this weird soft-porn limbo where there's always the innuendo, sexy costumes (no nudity!), and porno voices, but no actual sex occurs. Rather than focusing the sexiness into more in-depth, adult settings, it's kinda just prevalent throughout the entire production as a vague horniness, like the game is trying to keep me slightly aroused throughout for some reason. The majority of the time you're only gonna see sex and nudity if it's a porno or some ecchi anime. 

Anyway I just want my serious times and sexy times to be a bit more delineated instead of just an embarrassing soft-porn horn-fest all the time. That's my opinion after watching anime and playing games for 2 decades or so.

Edit: TL;DR fanservice is a shameless ploy to hook in horny teenagers and I'd prefer they either get rid of it or go all the way."
4113,unpopularopinion,"Even if your doggo is the goodest, most well trained doggo in the whole wide world, you’re still being a douche if you walk them without a leash","This is apparently a very unpopular opinion in the part of Colorado I live in. My dog has been in two scary fights in the last month while I’ve been out on a walk. In both, my dog was on a leash, and the other dog was not. My dog admittedly has a different demeanor around off leash dogs when he’s on a leash (he’s just fine in dog parks). But in both instances, the other dog came rushing up to mine as I was walking (despite the other owner calling for them) and almost instantly the dogs got into a fight. I had to be the one to break up the two mid sized dogs (40ish pounds) on both occasions, but the off leash dog was especially tough to get away from my own. 

On both occasions, the other owner insisted that this “never happens with their dog,” took zero responsibility, and had the audacity put fault on myself and my own dog. When I brought up that perhaps their dog should have been on a leash, they turned it around and implied I needed to get with the times and to mind my own business.

I’m still salty about this issue. Obviously it’s a slightly different issue if an owner is taking their dog on a walk in a secluded, cordoned off area - but I live in a residential part of the city and off leash doggos are very common in the community I live in.

EDIT: From some of the comments I should have clarified that my thread was meant for folks walking their dogs in **public, well populated areas** that are not designated off-leash areas like dog-parks."
4114,unpopularopinion,"True gender equality will be marked by nonchalance towards, not celebration of gender.","If true gender equality comes to fruition, then what it will mean is that people will stop giving a fuck about one another's gender. Everyone would have equal opportunity, treatment, respect and appreciation, while being judged based on character, ability, personality and other proper grounds based on the situation. There would be no need for gender-based celebrations, since all related hurdles would have already been crossed. 

What will be celebrated though, is mankind coming one step closer to overall human equality."

There are lots of streamers that make a great living off of it, and good for them! I'm not bashing on the streamers themselves, I just don't understand how people sit and watch these things for *literal* hours.

It seems like it would make more sense to just watch a highlight montage or some 10 min video of a play through. During a livestream everything is raw and uncut. Loading screens, buffering, long silences, and so much other annoying shit."

4124,unpopularopinion,The people defending the woman who lied to the police in Central Park are racists. Amazing how people suddenly are pro false accusations.,"Every single day, several times a day, we get complaining about how horrible false accusations are, and how severely women should be punished for making them.

Suddenly when we are literally watching a woman invent a false accusation live on video, we get a flood of posts how that was OK because she might have been scared.

One hell of a transition guys. False accusations are useful and valid now? I wonder if the races were reversed, would a black woman lying to the police on the phone to get a white man in trouble be OK too? Is she allowed to be scared and lie?"
4125,unpopularopinion,The idea that so many women will only date men who are 6ft or above is absolutely a myth perpetrated by men.,"I’ve literally only encountered this as something talked about by guys in the internet and I’m shocked anyone would think it’s a widespread thing. I’ve got a lot of female friends and have never heard any of them use that as a standard in dating. I mean logically why would they, most men (like 85%) would be eliminated from the dating pool if someone did hold that. Also it’s genuinely very hard to guess what someone’s height is, personally I wouldn’t be able to tell the difference between 5ft 10 and 6ft.

I have heard girls say they have a preference towards dating a guy who’s taller than them, but when the average female height is like 5 ft 4, that really doesn’t disqualify many guys at all. Even then there’s a decent amount of girls who don’t mind dating shorter guys, myself included. 

Conclusion - if you’re not incredibly short but complain that you can’t get a date because of your height, consider the fact that it might just be you."
4126,unpopularopinion,"Reddits constant edginess about religion is just immature, disrespectful & super hacky","I'm not even a huge bible thumper every  comment chain is ""Lol sky wizard"" or some similarly other overdone joke.


To be fair, I do NOT care about the jokes themselves. Bill Burrs ""Don't you think the Catholic church went a little too far?"" Is a classic & hilarious. I respect anyone creating their own jokes.



But the trend of just trying to be super literal hyperbolic with past religions thinking it's funny has become grade A hack material. For example ""Why bc your sky wizard told you to?"", ""Because a bunch of people are idiots & go to church to eat human flesh of their savior."". There is no real punchline in these jokes outside of the unexpected shock of someone dissing religion which is par for the course on reddit. Its basically become the ""I identify as an attack helicopter"" of religion.


It just feels like I'm 13 again hanging out w/ my buds on reddit going ""Yeah man you know how many wars were fought for religion?""



I honestly think it's less of a anti-religion thing for a lot of people and more of a faux intelligence ""Look at me & how smart I am for not believing this"""
4127,unpopularopinion,Dumbledore was never gay,"JK Rowling clearly demonstrated a traditional view of marriage throughout the books.

4129,unpopularopinion,Even if you win a debate the other opinion isn't inherently wrong,"A lot of people just don't know how to properly argue for different forms of view. I think that a lot of people just end up becoming flustered because deep down they know that their opinion has more merit than how it seemed when they argued it. 

A lot of people will find a weak debater, beat them in a debate, and then act like it somehow proves all their opinions were trash. 

Not only do you need a LOT of information memorized about a certain topic but you also need to be quick witted and good at improv. A lot of people just aren't able to do justice to their own opinions. That doesn't mean the stance itself is right or wrong. 

Now, yes these people SHOULD re-evaluate their opinion on something if they can't properly debate it... But realistically this doesn't happen and I can't control people. 

What we each can do, however, is try to argue against ourselves in order to find the truth."

It's an addiction."
4131,unpopularopinion,There are more pushy meat eaters than there are pushy vegetarians.,"I ate meat until early January, and I never really got pressured by annoying vegetarians/vegans. I had a *ton* of vegetarian and vegan friends, and none of them ever really tried to pressure me into giving up meat. I also live in Brooklyn, so it's not like there's a lack of vegetarians/vegans anywhere lmao. The only time I can think of was this annoying high schooler, but we were in debate club so I guess it makes sense.

However, I've been a vegetarian since January 2020, and the amount of resistance people give to me is insane. I'm not a pushy vegetarian. I hardly ever mention being vegetarian, only doing so when it comes up in conversation or we're talking about food or something, and I *never* have judged someone for eating meat. Yet every time it's revealed I'm vegetarian people respond horribly. They'll spend ages talking about how ""no no no meat is good for you"" and ""ohmygod I didn't think you were one of *those* type of people lol"" and ""c'mon it's just *animals*"". Like what?? Almost every meat eater I mention being vegetarian to tries to convince me to start eating animals again, whereas 99% of vegetarians I have met don't give a fuck if other people eat meat or not."
4132,unpopularopinion,13 reasons why is a bad depiction of mental health and should not be taken seriously,"For those who are unaware, 13 reasons why is a show about a girl who commits suicide and leaves behind tape recordings of why she did it. The whole message of the show seems to be that suicide is a good solution to your problems. An example of this is how Clay one of the characters in the show goes on a crusade of vigilante justice against the people on the tapes. 

It presents an idea that suicide is a method of vengeance towards those who wronged you. As a psychiatry resident I find this message very problematic, also in season 3 they try to make sexual assault victims into the bad guys. While justifying a serial rapist, ( Bryce walker) 

In season 1 it shows a scene of the girl killing herself, and the guidelines in my country at least. Do not recommend that suicide scenes be shown, and that they should only be implied. This is because scenes that show suicide could cause something called inspirational suicide (not sure if the term is correct). 

Basically In general the show is bad, and I do not recommend it for viewers who may be struggling with issues mentioned in the series. Also the writing and dialogue makes no sense and the characters actions are often inconsistent with their motivations."

He has endless resources that could fund the causes of crime like poverty, better schooling, funding the police. Or even activities for youths. But instead he wastes it farting about in the dark like a bellend coz he just wants to look hard in front of his elderly butler slave pal. Mans got the money to fund a cancer cure ffs.

4134,unpopularopinion,Hollywood should stop inventing African countries,"Hollywood uses real countries in when stories are set in other continents but almost always invents a fictional one when it comes to Africa. To make it worse, these fictional nations are always monarchies yet the continent only has 3 monarchies and 51 republics. Swaziland and Lesotho are tiny, insignificant and completely surrounded by South Africa. Morocco is the only significantly large monarchy. Is it so hard to set a story in Nigeria, Kenya or Congo? Why do we have to put up with weird sounding places like Wakanda or Luambo?"
4135,unpopularopinion,Higher paid jobs aren't harder then minimum wage jobs,"So 6 years ago I was washing cars at a dealership. 12 years ago I worked in food service. Between those I did retail. And within the past 6 years I worked retail sales.

My last 2 jobs (current and previous) are paying me a base salary of over 60k with total comp in the 6 figures. I work from home, very successful and quite frankly don't work that hard.

But holy fuck, retail, food service and washing cars was significantly more difficult than these jobs have been. Physically and mentally. 

As you make more jobs become less difficult. However they become less difficult with experience and education (which I have a ton of both)."
4136,unpopularopinion,It doesn't matter if it's just a drawing. Sexualising children in any way is fucking creepy and disgusting.,"I see this kind of stuff all the time on subreddits like r/rule34 and related subreddits.

It's disgusting and uncomfortable. They're *kids*. It doesn't matter if it's a drawing or not. And I'm really sick of the normalisation of this kind of paedophilia.

Hell, this shit is actually straight-up illegal in several countries, including the United States. Section 1466A of Title 18 of the U.S. Code specifically makes it illegal to create, view, or distribute visual representations—including drawings—of minors engaging in sexual acts.

This shit needs to stop. It's horrible and sickening."
4137,unpopularopinion,"We need to stop framing Nuclear energy as this evil, dangerous thing that we need to stop using","You read the title.

It's by far the safest and one of the cleanest method of energy production available to us right now.

No like seriously, there have been such few meltdowns that you could probably name all of them in under a minute. And although each of these accidents has been catastrophic, the death toll is still dwarfed by all of the mining accidents, oil rig accidents, deaths by gas leaks, and even accidents that happen whilst building dams and wind farms.

It is not an argument, Nuclear power is ***the*** safest option available.

The world needs to switch from fossil fuel to Nuclear now. It's the only solution to climate change. Expecting third world countries (or corrupt regimes like China, that don't give two shits about the Environment) to start building massive wind or solar farms is just not a realistic approach. We need to switch to Nuclear, and then slowly convert to Renewables when the threat of Climate change is (mostly) out of the picture. Or just pour funding into Fusion research and skip straight to that.

And whilst you might be wondering about Nuclear waste, well the thing is, there is just so little of it. The amount that will gather up in the 100 or so years it will take us to switch to Renewables or Fusion can simply be dug underground in remote locations or even shot into Space if that becomes cheap enough someday."

Masculinity from what I understand is being strong emotionally and striving to be the best you can. 
If a man picks on people weaker than them, overcompensates in their masculinity then they ain't masculine."
4139,unpopularopinion,Redditors are assholes,No offense but hear me out. So I’m pretty new to Reddit. Sure I’ve had my account for a while but I rarely use it. Why? Well until today I didn’t really have a reason but if I did it’d be because Redditors can be pricks. I like gaming and Fallout so I naturally I joined a Fallout subreddit and made the mistake of actually putting my opinion about my favorite F4 faction the Brotherhood of Steel on a shitpost about it. Immediately people just start downvoting my comment for no reason and pretty much being assholes about it. People even started calling me Hitler because I like the BOS. What’s with Redditors and being complete jerks? A game subreddit should be fun and spark an interesting conversation and while there were many people who could be civil most were pieces of shit. *sigh* Patrolling Reddit almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter.

New normal really rubs me the wrong way. It shouldn’t be normal to not visit our grandparents, stay 6 feet away from everyone around us, stand in long lines outside stores, not shake hands, and cover our faces. These are temporary measures we’re taking as a society FOR society - to get back to normal, not to make this the norm. Even if we have to do all this for the next 1-2 years I can’t call any of that normal, especially not the “new normal.”"

every single thread is one group hating another group, the cancel culture is disgusting

it’s full of entitled narcissists who’ve never been told no and have no counter points other than spamming gifs or saying things that are the equivalent of putting your fingers in your ears and blocking the other person out

i’ve never even got in a twitter argument because i don’t need the stress lol, but i’m finding it impossible to follow the people, companies, games i like without somehow getting some intense drama on my TL every. single day.

it’s people that shouldn’t have a platform to put their opinion on, racists against whites and poc, hypocrites, people who have no idea how the world works, and despite most of it all being completely serious views and opinions, any backlash just gets met with “it’s obviously a joke” 

it makes me heated lol i’m uninstalling but i have no idea how people use twitter it’s nothing but a rabbit hole of miserable people with nothing better to do than argue online all day

it’s just an app designed for people to argue with each other

It boggles my mind that people who believe the world is flat are comically brushed off, but believing that the position of space rocks, or your time of birth somehow affects your personality is accepted by the majority of people.

On a few occasions I've asked people who believe in Horoscopes what they think of religion and many of them have brushed it off as superstitious nonsense, which to me is comical that the concept of a man in the sky deciding your actions is nonsensical but a rock doing so is perfectly fine.

It's all fucking pathetic and maybe I'm just falling into some kind of troll pit, because there are so many tiktoks and snaps of people sobbing, and then trying to make it entertaining? It's fucking revolting, and it comes off so immature and manipulative. All those fucking kids who fake cried to their parents and got coddled for it haven't learned.

Their entire life is at the mercy of government policy, and the government has a larger direct impact on their lives than it does on non incarcerated people. If the purpose of incarceration is rehabilitation, shouldn’t we want the incarcerated to have a buy in the the society they hope to rejoin?

However, if pretty much all of your acquaintances and potential friends don’t like you, the problem is most likely you, not them. When this happens to a lot of people, a they tend to blame those who dislike them instead of thinking about how certain behaviors they displayed can turn a lot of people off.

For example; tornadoes. What is the point of tornadoes? They don't do anything but cause destruction. Yet if I asked someone that, they would be like ""its just nature, it's just the way it is"" without actually thinking about the overall question and point: Why does something like this exist? It's not really needed in life and does nothing but create negativity. Of course it is what it is, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't think about things radically or from a different perspective. People are just so ready to dismiss anything that requires deep and provoking thinking so they just cast it away as ""it is what it is"". Why is almost every ""system"" (with everything) in America so complicated? You'd figure a lot of these things would be revised and simplified already considering it's 2020. But ""it is what it is"". Of course this is my own perspective and opinion so it really doesn't necessarily matter if you agree or not (that's also not the point of this subreddit).

I know it sounds like fake humility, but why is everyone impressed when a guy can cook and clean. If I were a woman everyone would just take this for granted. It isn't like I am doing her a favour (I was already helping before, but now I am obviously doing everything), these things should be expected from men too. It applies to other things too, for example if a guy changes their kid's diaper or something. Like wow he is such a good guy.

The point of a job is to make money so of course, I'm going to care about how much I'm getting paid.

4156,unpopularopinion,having a mental illness does not allow you to be irresponsible or rude,"tldr below

speaking from personal experience, i had a serious depressive episode during a major exam period. my friends were so nice but somehow my brain told me to chase them away. when they offered to stay alongside me, i would shout at them because my logic was if they got angry, there'd be one less person who would be sad when i commit suicide.

but when a classmate talked to me about it, i realised that i was wrong. it's just like having anger issues and murder. if you kill someone because you have anger issues, that doesn't make the murder okay. You have a reason for it, but it is still wrong. similarly, shouting at my friends was wrong, even though justifiable.

for the irresponsibility part, it was because i had no energy to do any homework. I slept during class and slept when i went home because i just didn't have energy to do anything. i admit i was being irresponsible. so i told my teachers and my friends about it every time i could commit to something, so they would understand, and luckily, they were very accepting. if you are in this situation, i think the least you could do is to explain it to others, and try to better yourself step by step.

tldr: wrong will still be wrong, no matter what circumstance you are in. it isn't your fault you are struggling, but that is still your responsibility, and does not mean you should abuse other's patience."

4164,unpopularopinion,Pokemon games are mediocre and over-hyped,"I remember when I was a kiddo, everyone in my neighborhood and school played those, and talked about their leveled Pokemons, and which game was the best among them, etc etc. I get that as a kid you might like them, but those games go on and on for like 20 years, and you see grown up people hyping them and playing them as if they are some sort of gift sent from heaven, when it's clearly their nostalgia talking. That could be said for a lot of games like Zelda for example, but at least Zelda games evolve and try a lot more new things, whereas the Pokemon recipe has stayed strongly the same.

I will never get the reason Pokemon games get such a strong following nowadays when they are a really basic and unrewarding mediocre RPG experience that with each installment it feels the same thing all over again just with a different name and different Pokemons. BORING

Everytime some triggered Christian looks onto an atheist feed, they always pick out the most militant atheists and claim ""tHeY'rE nOt aThEiStS, tHeY'rE AnTi-ThEiStS."" Umm ok, and your point? Literally everyone who describes themselves as an anti-theist is, by definiton, an atheist. Christopher Hitchens wrote a lot about the distinction and specified that he is an atheist because he doesn't believe in God. He is also an anti-theist because, even if he was presented with sufficient evidence, he would actively work against said God. 

The two may not necessarily be interchangeable. But they sure can be."
4167,unpopularopinion,Bringing defeated villains back completely undermines established narratives and should stop.,"I dislike how it is becoming the norm in media to always bring back villains after they have been unrevokably defeated. It makes the entire previous plot feel pointless and devalues the prior experience. Take Star Wars for example (spoilers, obviously). The entire plot behind Darth Vader bringing balance to the force by killing Palpatine was demolished by bringing him back in the new series. What was the point of the entire first 6 movies? Was it all *really* intended to serve as a backstory for the resistance? Seems like it was all for nothing. This phenomenon isn't unique to Star Wars either, it is just the most prominent recent example of it.

Why can't someone that is suffering not make the choice to end their life? Why should someone who is young with bipolar have to spend the rest of their life fighting it? It's exhausting and that person has to live with it for 50+ years and medications either cause too many side effects or they build up a tolerance to it and it constantly has to be changed or increased. Why can't that person choose to end their life? If people can support suicide for people suffering from   terminal cancer, why can't people support suicide for someone constantly fighting just to get out of bed in the morning for their entire life?

They should have the right to choose whether they want to live or die."

Look, I can find and watch gay porn in a hot fuckin minute if i wanna stare at some dude's backup singers and the chocolate factory, but believe me when I say I don't.

It really doesn't help that the balls are always just an ass hair's breadth away from center screen, with nothing but man cheeks to cover the upper half. Why not put the woman's ass in the limelight, at the very least? I could be looking at her reaction, their profile, her POV, heck, a close-up of her back would be a better view at this point but no! Someone had to zoom in on Joe Random's coin purse so that everyone at home would have to skip a portion of the video or lose their hard-on. I'm not sure who thought of this particular angle, but im pretty sure they use that guy's IQ as the minimum bra size for actresses.

Edit: since yall seem so intent on saying it, obviously women watch porn. Guess what? a shot that is 70% ass and balls and 30% action is still a shit shot, whether they're male or female. putting the shot closer to the front of the balls would achieve the same thing with better visuals."

Obviously, very young children are likely wrong, but high schoolers not being listened to just because they’re legally still kids just seems wrong to me. It has always bothered me that parents, older siblings, teachers, etc. never believe kids, because they believe they’re just making excuses. But, more than ever before kids are getting exposed to certain topics at a younger age, and making their own conclusions, many of which are very rational and sophisticated.

However, I believe some people are honestly not worth forgiving. Mind you I don't spend my life angry and spiteful, and I do believe in the idea of forgiving for yourself and not the other person. Despite this, I think that there are just some things that should never be forgiven. I truly believe some people need to live with the fact that for the rest of your life, nothing can ever make me forgive what you did. I know this may sound edgy or too cynical, but I believe that some people need this. Saying you forgive them gives them unworthy comfort in the actions they did.

I hate it feels like we're all put in one giant rat race.  We're often told to work hard and do overtime, stay up late at night.  I don't push myself to overwork like modern society tries to push us to do. But I am perfectly happy where I am, working 9 - 5 in a department store and getting my 8 hours of sleep at night.

My peers around me have been traveling the world, like Egypt and Japan, and making big names for themselves and doing big things.

I believe they are entitled compensation for not being able to find a job. 

Personally, I would not have kids unless we're both having jobs, but that's just me.

The customer did not pay, so did not get them. The manager said they needed to be thrown away, but one of the cooks said he was about to go on his lunch and that he would pay for them. The manager agreed. I'm sure you see what I'm getting at. The little ""discount"" they would give us only applied to certain items. I do not eat beef, but I do eat chicken, so if I wanted chicken, I had to pay full price.

Some of the most downvoted comments, like the most upvoted, are little throwaway comments. Often attempts at humour and I've seen heavily downvoted comments which are witty and funny but just demonstrate an opposing view.

Downvotes should be tallied up but kept separate from upvotes. The difference between someone who has made lots of controversial contributions that even out to 0 and someone who has made no notable contributions is huge. But in the current system you can't distinguish between them.

Why is it poor advice? Because a 17/18 year old would know absolute jack about the best options or know what they like, telling them to major in the first thing they like is and has been a recipe for disaster. What needs to be done is give them proper information on the most marketable degrees.

Telling them to major in what they like will dramatically increase the likelihood of them majoring in something that likely has limited career potential, rapid buyer's remorse, and high likelihood of unemployment.

So I just came across this post on Reddit that was about this cop who was apparently kneeling on some guy who was dying or whatever. I didn’t read the full thing.

Whenever I hear about cops, it’s almost always about something bad that happened. I’ve very rarely heard or seen media cover something good that a cop has done. 

And thus, my unpopularopinion is that people hate cops because they only ever see them in a negative light, doing something bad."

4202,TwoXChromosomes,My husband gave the best ‘the talk’ ever,"I have two stepdaughters, who are currently 10 (we’ll call her B) and 15 (E). They’re pretty awesome kids, compassionate and funny and interested in the world. E just got herself her first boyfriend. He seems like a nice enough kid, but we haven’t really had the chance to meet him because they just started dating right before the lockdowns happened. They’ve been chatting and planning on getting together this summer some time when it’s safer. 

My husband decided they needed to have an explicit Talk. We’ve had multiple ideations of The Talk with both of them, as they’ve matured and different topics come up. Both of the girls are comfortable discussing this stuff with us (well, as comfortable as they can be considering). E regularly asks her dad to pick up period stuff and can discuss cramps etc with us freely. They’ve both had age-appropriate talks about consent and how they’re in control of their own bodies. They know what causes pregnancy, and have the appropriate safe sex info (obviously we haven’t gone as deep about that with B but we will as she ages). 

With E having a boyfriend now my husband knew he needed to have a more in depth chat with her. He sat down with her while I was engaged with B doing schoolwork so they wouldn’t be interrupted. 

You guys, I’m so proud of this man. He talked with her about safe sex and consent in the best way. He told her that it’s her body and her choice when to start having sex, and that all we care about is that it IS her choice and she shouldn’t feel pressured to do anything she doesn’t feel comfortable with. He told her that she should have all the information she can and should always protect herself, that a boy who pressures her to have sex she’s not comfortable with (or pressures her to not use protection) is not someone who cares about her, and that she should always feel like she can talk to us about any of these things and we won’t judge her. It was open and non-judgmental and focused on empowering her to make the best choices for herself without shame. 

I’m just so proud and in love with him right now. He’s so committed to raising them to be feminists who don’t put up with misogynist bullshit, it’s really wonderful to see this kind of parenting. I think coming from their dad it’s impactful in a different way, too (though of course they’re also surrounded by feminist ladiez). 

Just wanted to share a bit of good with the world. It seems like everything is shit sometimes but there are good men and women out there raising kids right and being good examples."

I guess it could be an honest mistake (still messed up imo that any post with a girl or woman gets sexual comments), but being downvoted by people when I comment her age is just sad. Sometimes I really feel like needing a break from Reddit because of things like this. For anyone reading this: thanks, just wanted to get it off my chest.

4208,TwoXChromosomes,"Years ago, he told people at work that I slept with him. Yesterday, ran across a news article saying he is in financial ruin.","Back then, women were routinely fired for having sex with coworkers so I was scared and angry. I decided the only way to stop “John” from destroying my career was to call his boss (“Larry”). Before I could finish explaining, Larry interrupted and said he “knows” John, and John would never do such a thing. So not only did John put my job at risk, his boss defended him as if it never happened. In an embarrassingly shaky voice, I told Larry if I heard from one more person that John claimed I slept with him, I would be suing Larry, his company, and John. After weeks of worry, I realized I would probably be ok. I never heard another word about them. Until yesterday. I saw a news article that Larry sued John after being business partners for many years. John went bankrupt, lost his $4 million house in an unrelated lawsuit, and was in utter financial ruin after scores of motions and counter-motions between him and Larry. It was so satisfying to know that John got his just desserts and so did Larry."

Adding insult to injury, people keep telling me to make sure I don't make this guy angry. Like I need to placate this human trash ago refuses to grow up, get a job, and instead gets by by stealing and threatening rape when caught.

I am tired of looking after my weight, because I am afraid it will make me undesireable.
 
I am tired of being judged by my loud laughter or jokes I make, random men just love to put you down when you are clearly enjoying yourself. 

I do not like being catcalled, I do not like getting comments about ""worms in my vagina"" by a group of guys who just want to offend me any way possible. 

I do not like that sexual harassment is a norm, and no one is actually interested. I have heard the comments ""Oh it is not that bad, others had it worse.""

I cleaned everything out. 
After some trial and error, it ended up being some loose fittings, but I feel so badass and accomplished for fixing it myself.

4214,TwoXChromosomes,Anyone else struggle with partners that don’t really help around the house?,"I love my boyfriend (28), but the resentment for him has been building slowly ever since we moved in together 8 months ago. I get angry when I spend so much time each day after work maintaining our house, keeping up with laundry, doing the dishes while he is in his messy and disgusting office playing video games or studying for the BAR exam. He doesn’t have a job yet because he’s busy with studying and living off his savings, so thankfully I don’t have to pay his share of the bills. It just sucks seeing him basically do whatever he wants while I’m trying to maintain pride in my home. 

I’ve tried to relinquish some of my duties onto him so that he doesn’t think I’m going to just pick up after him, but he will just let his things get messier until I have to cave in and clean, or he gets angry because I keep reminding him and he and cleans it himself. He thinks I’m attacking him every time I get a little frustrated, but asking him nicely just prolongs everything to where he eventually forgets. I ask him nicely, nothing gets done on time. I ask him in frustration, he thinks I’m being mean.

He also doesn’t understand the details to cleaning. Like, when you wash the dishes you also need to wipe the counters/stove top/sweep floor. No, he will just wash the dishes and leave a watery mess and visible food stains everywhere and think it’s clean. I try to show him but he again acts like I’m just this mean person for trying to show him. I’m at my wits end!

I’m thinking about starting a cleaning schedule where we both have to follow. What else has worked for you (besides ending the relationship- which may eventually happen but I’m trying to explore all my options here)."
4215,TwoXChromosomes,Please send positive vibes,"
The last few days and quarantine in general have been overwhelming, and I'm not doing so well mentally. I just need something to motivate me to keep going. Please send some positive vibes ❤️"
4216,TwoXChromosomes,My journey to thinking I'm pretty without makeup,"I've had a long battle with feeling like I wasn't pretty without makeup, as in I've probably felt that way for 12 of my 24 years. For so, so long I thought my face without makeup was hideous and embarrassing. I cried many tears and refused to go places if I wasn't wearing my armor. 

I started wearing makeup at 12 (little stuff like eyeliner and clear lip gloss) and learned slowly how to do a full face to cover up how ugly I thought I was. It increased steadily. In college, I was doing close to Insta glam every single day, fake lashes and all. It was a lot for every day, but I felt like there was nothing else that would work for me. It was full glam or bust. 

After college I started working for Chanel cosmetics, and they didn't sell false lashes so I couldn't wear them. I had to wear their mascara instead to promote it. I didn't find out until after I'd been hired and started working, and I legit had a meltdown. I thought I'd be hideous. I thought about quitting!!

I gradually got used to how I looked in just mascara and even came to enjoy it. After just a few weeks of mascara usage, I didn't even put on false lashes to go out one night for my birthday. 

At one point after that I had lash extensions and loved them because I could roll out of bed and not even need to apply ANY products to feel put together, including foundation. That was a huge step for me; I'd never felt okay without foundation.

I had to stop the extensions because my sponsorship ran out (I was getting them for free for about 6 months and they're expensive AF), plus I got an infection from the lashes. I was bummed, but not devastated. 

Fast forward to now and I used this extended time at home to figure out how to get my skin looking really nice. I started using Curology and they gave me zinc, which cleared up the texture on my skin in literally days. The tiny little texture on my face had made me insanely insecure for years, and now it's gone. My skin has never looked better!! I never thought I would get to this point. 

I've really come to embrace and actually love my face with minimal makeup. Most days I wash my face, apply an SPF moisturizer, put on mascara, and call it a day. Some days I don't use mascara. 

I went from being someone who would NEVER show up anywhere barefaced and would get anxiety just thinking about it to rocking being mostly barefaced and feeling really good and confident. I've been doing Zoom calls for work and don't feel like I'm a mess. In fact, I feel really pretty. 

To top it off, I got some external validation. I went on a friend's boat on Sunday (gatherings of up to 10 are allowed where I live) and we passed by a family the friend's family and my bf knew. Our friend's dad joked that they let my bf come because he brought a pretty girl. 

I never, ever would've thought anyone (besides my mom, younger sisters, and bf) would say I looked pretty without makeup. I started to feel confident, but hearing it from someone else was kind of a shock. It made me feel really good. 

So, it took 12 years from start to finish, but I finally am at peace. It took such a severe mental toll on me, and I wasted so much of my time and emotional energy projecting intense negative thoughts at myself. It was so unhealthy and so sad, and I'm feeling really refreshed finally being on the other side of this all."
4217,TwoXChromosomes,Are there any subs for women that like wearing dresses/sundresses that aren’t sexual?,"Sorry, weird question I know. But the only subs for these things that I can find are sexual for some reason? Like, I love wearing dresses and stereotypically feminine clothing. I was hoping for a sub that isn’t NSFW for people that like wearing dresses and exchange, where to get nice ones, making clothing etc. 


I know there are subs aimed at modest clothing (but I’d prefer one that isn’t for *only* modest ones) and ones for specific body types (petite, larger sizes, breast size etc.) but I think one for women of all sizes would be great. Does anyone know of any subs like this?"
4218,TwoXChromosomes,A Sex Education Rant,"Every time I hear someone complain about sex ed being in schools or when they promote ""abstinence only"" sex Ed I can't help but think of a few questions I will never ask them:

Do you really want your kids not knowing what sex is until they are in college? Or married? If your child is sexually abused do you really want to take away the tools they need to explain what happened and get help? Do you really want your daughter to think she's dying when blood starts spewing out of a hole she didn't know she had? Do you want your son to tear some poor girl on their first time because they didn't know lube existed? Do you want your daughter afraid to use a tampon because you told her vaguely that ""sticking something up there is how you lose your virginity""? Do you want your child getting pregnant because you didn't tell them the facts about condoms? Do you want your daughter to be afraid to tell her doctor the truth about her terrible cramps because she knows you will villify the doctor if he offers birth control to help? Do you want your child to be so scared of you that she never talks about relationships with you? Do you want your child learning how his body works from misinformation on the internet? Do you want them finding out how sex works by reading through the encyclopedia or some random? 

Or would you rather they learn how the human body works in a structured environment with medical and professional language? Would you rather they come to you with questions or when they need help with a relationship? Would you rather they get the answers they deserve? 

Because these are the things that ""just ignoring it"" or ""abstinence only"" sex Ed will get you.Maybe it's just a small corner of the world. But maybe it's not. And that worries me."
4219,TwoXChromosomes,How to get over insecurity about labia?,"I'm pretty young, [18] and a virgin, and for years now I've been bullied and feeling ashamed and awful because my labia minora are fairly large/long, to the point as a preteen I even googled how much it would cost to get surgery and what work I'd have to do to earn that etc. It kills me every time I see posts about how ugly they are or people joking about them etc. I understand people can have preferences, but I don't want to turn to surgery for something that isn't my fault that I was born with. I don't believe they are long/large enough to require surgery on their own, although I'd have to double check that with a doctor (I believe past a certain length and level of discomfort etc they are actually eligible for surgery that would be not covered by you as it's considered abnormal). Basically, I would really like to get some advice on how to get over some of this insecurity because it's one of the worst insecurities I have and one of the only reasons I'm still a virgin. Thanks!"
4220,TwoXChromosomes,I hate how difficult it is to manage my own reproductive power.,"This a just a rant I guess. 

Condoms make sex feel bad for me. They almost make it more likely for a UTI to happen. If I don't pee directly after sex, boom, UTI a day later. So no condoms. 

But the side effects from birth control... I'm so nervous about getting on it because historically speaking my body is super sensitive. I know I need to get some for of bc because I want to take my own reproduction into my own hands. But I can't help feeling super resentful. Like if I get on some form of pill that's nerve wracking because that's a lot of hormonal changes happening in my body and it scares me! I've had hair fall out from changes in hormones. 

At the same time, I know I need to get on something because if I don't and make a mistake, I'll have to get an abortion. I'm definitely not having kids for a while, maybe never. But I dont really want to put myself in a situation where I have to terminate a pregnancy. 

So then I have to get an IUD or the arm implant right? But I've heard those can have bad side effects too. 

And we're not even talking about periods and what those do to me. 

I grew up in a patriarchal, conservative Catholic atmosphere where all of these things are super glossed over. It feels like people (women!! Women don't share these things with young women!) never told me or any of my friends what to expect when it came to the hardships of being a woman. Just ""stop being dramatic"". And now a bunch of my peers and I are dealing with the consequences in different ways. 

Just needed somewhere to rant about these feelings. I'm sure I'm not alone with them, unfortunately. Shout out to my ex-catholic ladies."
4221,TwoXChromosomes,RANT: This healthcare system is embarrassing when it comes to women's health.,"I've been dealing with recurrent UTI's for close to 2 years now (like I'm talking about a frequency of almost 2 a month at one point), and no one has had answers for me. It was always walk-in clinics, ER's and countless rounds of antibiotics (sometimes the wrong ones!) thrown down my throat. And yes, I've done all the classics - drinking lots of water, D-Mannose, cranberry, cotton panties, etc. Anything you could think of. I finally found this angel of a family doctor who listens to my concerns, helps me with whatever she can and refers me to anyone she thinks can possibly help me. It's everyone else that's the problem.

I've been able to hold off my UTI's pretty well through diet, hygiene and hydration so I have managed to be okay for the last couple of months. Was feeling a little pain recently whenI went for a urine culture/chem test 5 days ago when I was feeling slight burning once again, and got my chem test back positive for Leukocytes. So like, okay cool, lets see what the culture says... SO I waited. And waited. And today, (after waiting 5 DAYS for the culture), the lab straight up said ""we inadvertently omitted this test"". LIKE WHAT. HOW. HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN. My test just never happened.

So now I have to get retested, and hope that this time someone more competent handles my stuff. This has given me so much anxiety.

This was all after a urologist throwing his hands up and telling me to drink more water and take cranberry supplements to cure my recurrent UTI's when he couldn't find an easy answer for me. Even my family doctor seemed disappointed that he didn't do more. I can't even explain how degrading and disappointing that whole experience was.

&#x200B;

Why do we have to fight SO hard and advocate for ourselves with this healthcare system that simply just does not give a shit about women's health and struggles? Why do we have to deal with so many let-downs just to get answers, albeit sometimes not the easiest ones to get?

I am incredibly thankful for my family doctor who has been what seems to be my only ally in this fight. This whole experience has kind of just opened my eyes to how messed up the system is."
4222,TwoXChromosomes,IUD maybe lost inside my body from two years ago... feeling scared,"Two years ago I had an abortion but 2 months prior to the abortion I had an IUD placed. Before the abortion the doctor could not find the IUD on an ultrasound and told me that it probably expelled. However, I never felt or saw anything resembling and IUD come out of me so recently I have been worried that it somehow is still inside me and maybe even perforated my uterus and is in my body cavity. I contacted Planned Parenthood and they have no record of it being removed during my abortion and they said I should have had an X-ray done at the time to see where it was. I feel like someone dropped the ball by not letting me know I needed follow-up care at the time and I am really scared. I finally was able to schedule an appointment with an OBGYN to see what they suggest since it’s been two years but I am super embarrassed about my situation and for not seeing a doctor sooner and I am terrified of what will happen if the IUD is still inside of me. I’m sorry if this isn’t right for this sub I just needed to vent and maybe get feedback if anyone has anything."

If you are in a manipulative relationship and your partner threatens to kill themselves because you want to break up with them. You should still proceed.

When I found out I broke up with him, but instead of being immature and storming out I talked to him about why he did it and made him understand how intensely he hurt me.

I guess he got the message because he told me he was going to kill himself. I don't know to this day if it was guilt or manipulation but me still being there for him and me still trying to be someone he could consider a friend to talk to, he didn't do it. He is very much still alive and is in a long term relationship now.

In conclusion, if someone is threatening to kill themselves because you broke up with them, go through with it, just use caution and compassion because in their twisted minds they don't realize they are being manipulative and would say anything to get you back."

4235,TwoXChromosomes,I’m a boss and apparently I’m an anomaly in that I stand up to sexual harassment for my team?,"I’m a (39f) manager of a corporate-owned food service establishment with very high customer service standards, and yesterday morning I had a conversation with “old creeper dude,” an older man who came through every single morning and has made every single one of my female staff feel uncomfortable, including myself. Note: everything he’s said has been juuuust on this side of “this could be a compliment depending on who said it.” 
Anyway, I finally had that convo yesterday morning (took longer than it should have, tbh, because I hate doing these), and this morning was following up with my team, explaining that they don’t have to wait for me to say something—if a customer makes them uncomfortable, they don’t have to laugh, don’t have to brush it off, can just say “sir, that makes me uncomfortable, please don’t say it.” (I want to emphasize that they don’t have to and I am more than willing to do it, but I also want to give them the agency to advocate for themselves and know that I will completely back them up.) 
And one of my team member said “part of the reason we struggle to do that is because I have never before had a boss who would back me up. They brushed off my complaints of being uncomfortable.” 
I. Am. Shook. 
Is this really where we are as a culture? People aren’t advocating and protecting the team under them? Isn’t that literally the job of a boss? 
I guess the #metoo movement should have taught me that no, bosses do not have the best interests of their employees in mind. But...really? Come ON ladies. We can do better than this for the people on our teams! 
I don’t know what my point was to all of this except that I was flabbergasted."
4236,TwoXChromosomes,For the first time a man made me cry out of happiness instead of sadness.,"Sorry if this is long or rambly, but none of my guy friends really “get it.” Also I’m on mobile, so sorry if there’s any formatting issues. 

TL;DR: I have a bad history with relationships and sex and my boundaries not being respected. My boyfriend finally made me feel like I’m enough for someone. 

I didn’t date all through high school. I was shy, overweight, awkward, and geeky. No self esteem. The summer after high school I got emotionally involved with two guys: the friend of a friend, who was 4 years older than me, and a guy I met online, who was 15 years older than me. The former told me he loved me, he wanted me, but he couldn’t be with me, which made me feel like shit. The latter manipulated me into doing sexual things over webcam and got furious if I talked to other guys. 

After I while I stopped talking to both of them (the latter started scaring me, and I found out the former was making fun of me behind my back) and went to college where I got my first real partner. Our relationship was good but we had a terrible sex life, my libido jumped up and down due to stress, birth control, anxiety, and then guilt over feeling like a bad partner. In addition she was really only interested in very kinky stuff, and after a while the power imbalance in that kinda triggered some repressed memories of the guys before college and I shut down around any mention of sex, which she didn’t understand even after my explanations.  

Anyway that relationship went belly-up finally about 8 months ago, after 7 years. I began dating my other good friend from college and at first was stressing the same way, because he’s a lot better looking than me, would I be gross to him, too boring, etc. Thankfully he didn’t have really any experience before me and really let me set comfortable boundaries. 

That’s the backstory. The last time we were together in person, we were just relaxing in bed after sex, and apropos of nothing he said “you know, I honestly can’t think of any way our sex life could get any better.” Y’all, I tear up still every time I think about it. It finally feels like I’m compatible with someone, that I’m “enough” for someone. I finally feel not just loved but respected. 

I hope everyone gets a chance to feel like that at some point. I’m over the moon. I can’t wait for quarantine to be up so I can see him again (he lives in a neighboring state unfortunately)."
4237,TwoXChromosomes,What it means to be a woman,"As a young social worker with lots of interest in psychology, it is no secret to me that children will learn from their parents what it means to be an adult.
More specifically, boys will learn what it means to be a man from their father, while girls learn what it means to be a woman from their mother (of course their are always exceptions depending on family dynamics).

Recently, my older sister came up to me, saying she is unhappy in her relationship, but can not break up, because he didn't do anything wrong.
It reminded me of my 5 year long lasting ex relationship, where I was unhappy for more than 4 years but I never had the courage to break it up.

I wondered why we are so similar until I thought of our mother.

Our mother has always been in abusive relationships, where she was cheated on, belittled and not respected. Yet, she always stayed until she was left. She taught us it is courageous and brave of a woman to give herself up in order to keep a relationship. That being a woman means that your worth is based on how much you are willing to sacrifice yourself for the man you are with.
The more abusive things you overlook to stay, the more pride you will gain.
Your happiness is not important, but your loyalty to your SO is. 

Seeing this for the first time so so clearly in front of me feels empowering.
Because I have grown past this behavior and can help my sister and others to do that too.

You are no villain for ending a relationship. You are not evil for standing up for yourself. It is okay to break up a relationship, even if your partner didn't do anything wrong. You have the right to go if you want to. No one can force you into a relationship except for yourself and past morals you carry with you.
Having no more feelings towards your partner is no crime and you have the right to leave. 

Please be brave and treat yourself with respect.
Be loyal to yourself. Be respectful to yourself.

You are a human being."
4238,TwoXChromosomes,TW: My Friend’s a R*pist and I’m Overreacting,"I don’t know exactly why I’m posting this here, but it’s probably due to my anxiety surrounding the situation. I know that what I did was right, and I have no regrets, but it sucks to have to lose a friend group by deciding I don’t want to be friends with a Rapist. 

Several of my friends recently told me, that one of our friends is a Rapist. The information was delivered with a flippant remark, apparently seeking to make comedy out of a tragedy. The Rapist fed a 4’11 tall 90lb girl seven shots throughout the course of the night and escorted her back to a friends house. The Rapist lost his virginity by raping a woman. The aforementioned joke all centered on the Rapist’s question, “Is it normal that she couldn’t keep her legs open?” No, no it’s not. If she’s unconscious, whether for the entirety of the crime, or waking in and out of a nightmare, it is rape. If she is drunk, she cannot consent. This is what I said as my male friends laughed uncomfortably, waiting for the punchline of a joke that was not coming. 

“Did you tell him it was rape?” I asked my friend, a man I previously dated for 3 years. A man I thought was an ally. 

“I told him it was wrong.” 

Wrong is running a red light, cheating on a test, lying to your parents. Rape is rape. Wrong does not begin to encompass the evil of rape. 

I left group chats and snaps, choosing my morality over my desire to please others. I’m not a martyr or hero, the decision came as easily as my repulsion. Refusing to be friends with a rapist is the barest of human decency. 

“Why did you leave the group.” A male friend messages. 

“I don’t want to associate with a group that tacitly supports a rapist by staying quiet.” I respond. 

“You know that’s not the case, but is that all that makes you wanna leave? I wouldn’t stop you for making a decision based on what you think, but i’d also miss talking to u when we’re all together n stuff, and i guess wanna make sure that ur doin ok outside of that?” His message burned fire in my veins. 

Of course there must be something else wrong with me, my reaction must be clouded by volatile emotions. Are you sure you want to die on this hill? You’ll lose your friends. I’d miss you, but I’d choose being friends with a rapist over being friends with you. 

That’s not rape, that’s a mistake, I can hear his hollow arguments echo in my empty mind. This was a man I was close with, a man who is a gender studies minor. But practicing allyship proves complex when the rapist is not a name or a hashtag, but your friend. 

The women in my friend group are “proud of me.” They “support my decision.” They told The Rapist, “What you did was wrong, and serious.” Between shots of vodka and pulls of a blunt. Quite the court was held I’m sure. The Snapchat stories of rolled back eyes and giggling would be the ideal environment to confront a rapist. A rapist you drink with. A rapist you smoke with. A rapist you’ve shown will have no consequences for his actions. But after all, if your friends always want to get fucked up together, they don’t actually love you. They love the space you create in the room while they chase pleasure. Taking the oxygen into your lungs makes their suffocation slightly better. 

If you read this far: thank you. Thank you for listening to a story I wish I didn’t have to tell."

I also have bleeding in between periods. It usually lasts for about 4-5 days, sometimes even more. This has been happening for quite some time.

I've also noticed that over the past year, I've been feeling depressed and having suicidal thoughts one week before my period. It happens every month.

I am not over or underweight. I don't take any kind of medicines. I don't drink or smoke.

4244,TwoXChromosomes,Body image during Covid19,"In these few months in quarantine I have found myself feeling worse and worse about my body/appearence and I think it is all tied a lot to Covid.

First the zoom calls. I get to look at my face (which has major resting b**** face) during my meetings. I hated seeing my bags, my big nose, round face...sometimes I put on makeup for the call just so I don't feel as bad looking at my face. I still have to go into the office three times a week and early on I didn't wear any makeup one day. My coworker (who is a friend outside of work and is a woman) said I looked like i got hit by a train...

Fitness. I used to go to a lovely community gym and took classes a few times a week. The women in the classes were a bit older than me and none of us had amazing bodies, but we all exercised together and it was fun. Now I've been using YouTube to get routines so my feed is full of hundreds of women with perfect bodies teaching me abs and all I can do is poke my tummy and feel so big. I got full after lunch yesterday and actually felt guilty about it...I know that that is a bad thought, and I don't plan on starving myself...but it crept in none the less. It's hard because I can't let my mind dwell on world events too long or I'll cry but then I hyperfocus on myself and feel terrible. Even on my hike yesterday which was meant to clear my head...I just found myself comparing my body to every woman I saw.

I wonder if anyone else has felt this way? It seems so trivial to worry about my appearance during this time."
4245,TwoXChromosomes,Trying to loose weight as someone allready thin,"During quarantine and with not working for seven weeks I thought it would be good to become more active. I started to workout every day and eat healthyer. I lost weight and became happier with myself and how I look.

With going back to work I told a few people that I'm dieting and that I would like to become thinner.

*sorry but first world problems ahead*

Hers the problem that I face every time I tell someone. They laugh and  tell me I don't need to do that, where I'm even trying to loose weight. That I'm ridiculous about even thinking about that. They say I got a perfect body and therse no need for me to even loose a single gram.

Therse allways a way to say things nicely but some of them are really missing the point of beeing polite. It's not that they are not right. There is no way that I absolutely need to loose weight but If I want to why not? Why shouldnt I bee more happy about myself, why shouldn't I be more confident with myself. 
They aren't trying to be mean, Im pretty sure they even think it's a compliment.

4251,TwoXChromosomes,Valedictorian and The Imposter Syndrome,"A couple of years ago when I graduated high school, I was announced as valedictorian of my graduating class. Of course, I was thrilled, as I spent the majority of my high school career loading up on AP classes and studying my butt off to earn that title. 

The salutatorian was a boy in my close friend group, and he and I were friends. I didn’t think there were any hard feelings with it, as I’d been ranked #1 for a couple of years, and he only barely beat out the girl who was #3 for the salutatorian spot.

I really haven’t given much thought to it since then, as I’m in college now and honestly high school rankings don’t mean a thing. I’m still proud, but it definitely isn’t a huge deal. 

However, I ended up having a catch-up conversation with another male friend of mine last week who told me that the other boys in my high school friend group were majorly talking bad about me behind my back (when it happened), saying I didn’t deserve to be valedictorian because I wasn’t as smart as the salutatorian and I “played the game” to win and got it because I’m a girl. The boy who was saying this was actually one of my really really good friends - he and I had been friends since elementary school, and I never thought he’d be saying mean things behind my back. Apparently, our other male friends all agreed with him, but nobody ever came to my face and told it straight to me. 

I never doubted that I shouldn’t have gotten it. I know I worked really really hard, but now I’m kind of second guessing myself. The Imposter Syndrome and all that. If my close friends think I didn’t deserve it, then did I really? If I’m not smarter than the salutatorian, then am I really just kinda faking it until I make it? 

Does anybody have advice for me about the Imposter Syndrome? I know that this really doesn’t matter in my present life anymore, but what else do my old friends think about me that I don’t deserve? Why wouldn’t I deserve it if I worked so damn hard? And why does the fact that I’m a girl discount any of that?"

When we cleared up that yes, I do actually have an injury it became ""when I first started cycling I couldn't climb hills and it was because my muscles were weak, your shoulder is weak"". 

Wait, wasn't that kinda what I started out saying? I threw out a ""thank you for mansplaining my injury to me"", which was countered by ""men can be condescending to men too, they're just trying to be helpful, I don't believe in the phenomena of mansplaining"".

4253,TwoXChromosomes,"Unsatisfied with ""girl-power"" events and webinars","I'm a woman in a male-dominated field (IT) and I like attending events for women in STEM or professional women in general, because I hope to get interesting stories and find role models.

However, lately I've been pretty dissatisfied with most of these events because of the way they're usually structured.

&#x200B;

It goes somewhat like this: the talk starts with the presenter showing statistics about double standards, wage gaps, lack of women in leadership... you get it. Then she tells some stories about how she was treated unfairly because of sexism, and she asks confirmation from the audience that they have had similar experiences.

Now, am I crazy in thinking that this is getting boring? We already know these things: we experience them every day. If anything, it should be men that get shown this stuff. What's the use of collectively whining about it for most of the event? I get it, it can be cathartic to share your story about discrimination and other issues that you faced as a woman, but I don't think this is the place to do it. It ends up derailing the conversation, because it turns into a game of who can tell the biggest sob story about being a woman in 2020.

What I want to hear about are the possible solutions, the ways we can change society instead of just complaining about the state it is in. I'd like to walk away from these conversations feeling actually empowered and with some actual ideas for a better future. 

&#x200B;

Instead, I think that right now attending these gatherings is like reading a motivational self-help book and then going on with your life as before: the book makes you feel good for a while, but it doesn't actually change anything.

I majored in psychology in hopes of one day being a therapist, and I’m currently working at a mental health clinic as a case manager. I semi-recently decided that I don’t want to be a therapist, but rather get my MSW and do something on a more macro level (head a nonprofit, go into policy, etc). I thought that this was a good plan.

However, last week, it felt like a switch just flipped. Suddenly, I wanted to write a book, create art, make a podcast, quit my job (that I really enjoy) and travel the world while somehow making difference, etc. you get the idea. 

I’ve always been into painting but I’m not very creative and I’m not very good at taking risks. I have no idea where this is coming from. Is this a quarter life crisis or something? I have no intentions to quit my job, but I am starting some side projects to try to fill that creative void. I’m now second guessing if I should start applying to MSW programs or not because it feels like I’m being pulled another direction, but it’s terrifying because I don’t know if it’s just my brain telling me I need more creative outlets or what’s going on.

Fast forward to pandemic. It's hot, we're on lockdown. I have a 5month old baby, house is hectic. Haven't had a chance to do anything with my hair since before pregnancy. My partner asks me to shave his head because it had gotten pretty wild. As I'm shaving I muse ""I always wanted one of those side shaves""


He doesn't know what it is so I show him. ""Go for it"" he says. I'm baffled, reminding him that he said he likes long hair. ""I think you underestimate how much I like you period"" he replies. I go back and forth a little, wondering am I too old for such a haircut (31), too chubby-faced, should I be more ""momlike"" now etc. He's pretty supportive so I go for it.


Y'all probably reading this with your cute pixie cuts and undercuts wondering wtf I even made a post about but it was so amazing to me. I didn't cry, I loved it. I watched a video, bobby pinned up the hair to save and he very carefully did as instructed. I absolutely love it! It's actually pretty versatile and I put the part over so I can hide it if I want. Feels pretty liberating to just go for it. I figured if he fucked it up I'm on maternity leave anyway lol but it was great!


I message my mom all happy and she says she never liked that style because it looks too militant feminazi. (Before she even saw mine). I'm like ok.... Killjoy. Good thing I'm not a teenager so I couldn't give a fuck! I still wondered if my partner would regret it but he finds it hot AF and I love it too.

4262,TwoXChromosomes,Vasectomies and Tubal Litigation in the South,"Edit: Ligation (sorry, don't know where my brain was this morning!)

Hi everyone. I am a student nearing the end of their degree and I'm currently doing a research paper on tubal ligation access vs. vasectomy access. I'd like some personal anecdotes about this  experience, however, with universities closed it has been hard to reach out to certain demographics in which I could obtain  this information. I am looking for people located primarily within South US (Georgia preferred).

If you don't mind commenting or PM'ing me so I can reach out to you, I have a few questions that I'd like to ask. Everything will be anonymous!

This isn't necessarily a study, but more so stories of personal experience."
4263,TwoXChromosomes,Looking for some advice... endometrial ablation? Mini pill? Tubal ligation?,"I’ll try to sum things up without getting bogged down in too much detail.

I was always anxious about sex growing up. I was never able to use tampons. I had limited but painful experiences with fingering in my late teens/early 20s. Wanting more control over my periods led me to go on the pill at 19. Lost my virginity at 28, super painful. Went off the pill at 30. More super painful sex at 31. Finally decided to look into things when I met a guy I really liked who was very sweet and patient and showed me that fingering could actually be pleasurable. Experienced the most excruciating pain of my life with my first Pap smear at 32. Diagnosed with vaginismus. Periods are now regularly 9 days and I also have a cyclical burning that’s worse at the start and end of my period. Randomly developed an ulcer on my lady parts at 33 which after healing left me with provoked vulvodynia. Tested negative for all the usual stuff with the cyclical burning and the ulcer. Tried tranexamic acid for my long periods, they did get lighter but stayed at 9 days. Got an IUD inserted 6 months ago, periods have gotten longer, now often 14-16 days, though much lighter (maybe 1 day with pads, the rest with liners). A few months ago I did a course of prednisolone (the only thing that ever worked to heal the ulcer) for just over 3 weeks and then around the same time started on amitriptyline for the vulvodynia, which I stayed on for just under 6 weeks. My pain is relatively low compared to where it’s been in the past, but my periods are still a lot longer than I’d like, and I’ve been struggling with arousal and orgasm which I’m not sure of the cause of (Mirena, prednisolone, amitriptyline, isolation stress?)

So. My next gyn appointment is in September and I want to start thinking about some options. I’d rather avoid a pill with Estrogen as they are linked with vulvodynia. I have no desire to have kids so am ok with more permanent options if that’s best. I just want my periods to be a bit shorter, no sexual pain, and give me my orgasm back!!!

Help?"
4264,TwoXChromosomes,Hairfall remedy?!,"Hi All! Hope you’re doing well. I’ve been losing my hair for the past two ish months and it’s pretty bad by now. My hairline is pushed a lot farther back and the sides are almost empty. It’s really taking a toll emotionally. I’ve had this before but it fell much slow and there was less hairfall. However, last time I also had a bald spot in the back of my head. I used to get oil massages and thankfully that went away(don’t really know if it was the oil.) I’m not able to go to the doctor at the time of course. I was wondering if any of you wonderful ladies have dealt with this or if anyone may know any remedies?"

4266,TwoXChromosomes,Nipple discharge? Possible lump?,"So I'm a 28/f and I have literally no idea how to adult and I'm a little freaked out.
So today after the shower, I noticed one of my nipples had some discharge coming out of it. I knew what it was, been pregnant before, but I dont believe I'm pregnant now and if by some chance I am it would be veeery early in the pregnancy so I dont even think it would be happening yet. And it's only coming from one breast.    

Started reading about wtf could be happening and breast cancer came up. Never done a self breast exam before (I know terrible adult), so while it kind of seems like there could be some things that would be concerning, I have no previous examination of myself to base it on and it could very well be my hypochondria and panic kicking in. Breast is bigger than the other (was it always?), there kind of seems to be maybe a bump in my armpit area but again I dont know what I'm looking for and fear could be playing a role in all of this.    

I have no insurance, I havent seen a doctor for probably 8 years, I dont even know how to begin figuring out if this is serious or not. I'm stupid, and a little scared and could use help. Do I just call any doctor in town and make an appointment? Can it be a general practitioner or do I need to find an obgyn? Are doctors even seeing people right now with the quarantine? I feel so stupid asking these questions but I'm lost."

4272,TwoXChromosomes,"Book recommendation: ""Hood Feminism: Notes from the Women That a Movement Forgot""","&#x200B;

I just finished this book and am so glad I bought it. It was a thorough and thoughtful examination of how mainstream feminism has mostly benefited women who are already privileged, while failing nearly all other women.  And while telling some hard truths to women who believe they are good feminists, it also laid out what needs to change to achieve fully intersectional feminism. 

This book took ideas that, for me, existed as individual threads and connected them in a new way. I learned a lot.

4273,TwoXChromosomes,Has the Karen trend made anyone feel similar,"I haven't  been around the world but in America we use words like ""white"" to describe the color of someone's skin complection and ""black"" as a reference of ancestral origin based on that complection but in my opinion these 2 examples highlight a few significant portions of our already deeply rooted society here in America. Our history but also the damaging stereotypical perceptions that were and are apart of that history and to the perceptions that are still commonly found today.

""...people have done some pretty fucked up shit"" is a common sentiment I hear about white people but this strongly manipulates evidence I think to fit a particular demonizing narrative. I don't submit to the mystical abilities of karma but it's undeniable that people ,of all colors or countries, have made horrendous choices in their past including this population of ""white"".

It's not my intention to minimise that actions of any abusers or to try and lower the consequences for their intentional and understood actions but I am of the opinion that people are just people. Silly little arrogant selfish greedy horny self righteous little pieces of matter.  I'm also of the conflicting opinion that 100s of years of enslavement segregation and racism are 100s of years of enslavement segregation and racism and that it shouldn't be hidden or downplayed to any degree as part of US history.

Regardless I still wonder who are the casualties effected by this new Karen trend and are we dehumanizing those who are undeserving along with the guilty? Some people say fuck them and others like myself don't know what to say."
4274,TwoXChromosomes,Am I doing women wrong for enjoying my “old fashioned” gender roles?,"I am a long time member of this group, first time posting. I think I just need confirmation that I’m not doing anything wrong. My boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years. We live together, no kids or pets (want to have a bigger place with a yard) Plus we like having the ability and financials to do what we please for now. He is a hard worker, as am I. Since Corona, I have been working from home. This is where I am getting mixed feelings from some family and friends. I am thoroughly enjoying being able to have a clean and tidy home with dinner ready for my man when he walks through the door. Since I’ve been home I do a lot more cooking and cleaning and regular upkeep, but I have the time and I enjoy it. He does not expect me to pickup these things but appreciates when I do. He is not one to complain about not having clean clothes as he also knows how to run the wash. I just enjoy “caring” for him. I have heard many comments about how i “shouldn’t be expected to do this”, how “he has legs too”, “maybe he should take a turn”, “you shouldn’t have to earn your stay” etc. like I’m being taken advantage of. At first I brushed it off, but it’s got to the point where I wonder if I’m doing something wrong. As I said, I’m enjoying this “stay at home” lifestyle and I feel no way pressured to keep up these standards.

4275,TwoXChromosomes,Am I supposed to settle for a guy with my looks or do I aim higher?,"I’ve noticed a pattern in my life. I’ve only ever crushed on buff, athletic, tall, (mostly) conventionally attractive guys. 
However, I don’t look like a cheerleader myself. The guys I get are either unattractive, overweight, or good looking but a head too short for me.

I’m not saying I choose men by their looks. I’ve dated a few of the men who are attracted to me. I let the first one talk about how attractive other girls are in front of me, and I let the other take my first kiss. I tried not to be shallow. I let a guy kiss me after we just met. Because I know I have no other option. But at the same time I do. “Just give them a chance.” People say, but I do. And then they say “Never settle.”

I meet the guys who are attracted to me and I say “well even if they are unattractive if I stay with them they will be a wonderful person on the inside” but they never are. I’ve been trapped in relationships with people I’m not attracted to or have anything in common in any way because if I spare their feelings and be shallow, I’ll end up alone. 

And even if they are nice I can’t help the fact that I just don’t want them to touch me or kiss me. I know I’m supposed to. I know I’m shallow. But I just can’t help it. 

I don’t know how I will ever find love because my heart always wants the men who don’t want me and never will. 

I feel like one part of society is telling me that beauty is on the inside but another part is saying date someone you are attracted to. I feel like my arms are being pulled in two directions and my body is slowly being torn in half. I don’t understand anymore. It’s like I’m supposed to be attracted to the men who are attracted to me but whenever I give them the chance I just can’t be.

I’m going to die alone."
4276,TwoXChromosomes,Best way to handle catcalls?,"Went for a solo walk in my downtown neighborhood today. It was nice out, people were around, I had a tube top, baggy shorts and mask on. 

I got catcalled every 20 feet by men within the first few blocks. I had headphones on and would point at my covered ears when men would raise their voices and repeat themselves when I didn’t respond, hoping it would give them the idea that I couldn’t hear them but they kept talking (and I obviously could hear them- I’m in the habit of turning the volume down when a man starts shouting at me so I can hear if they follow me). Two men even walked up to cut me off (within 6 feet of my personal space and without masks on), one was trying to show me something on his phone?

I hate it so much. It makes me uncomfortable, I want to give them my middle finger or tell them to “f*ck off” but I try to be nice just nod and point at my headphones. I don’t want to provoke. But I’m so angry, I’ve been fuming since I got home. I was trying to have a nice walk to get out of the apartment and I felt threatened, disrespected, and honestly used- these men assumed my body was for them to look at, my time was theirs to take up, like I was there to talk to them.

I overall regret not changing into something with more coverage before leaving. It’s something I forgot about with being isolated for so long, working from home I’ve enjoyed wearing whatever is comfortable and makes me feel good. The last time I was in public it was much colder and puffy coats and snow limited the harassment I guess.

But men shouldn’t act like this- regardless of how a woman is dressed!

What is the best way you either deal with street harassment and/or take care of yourself afterwards? I’m still experiencing anger and anxiety and it happened hours ago."

4279,TwoXChromosomes,My abortion was not traumatic.,"When I was 26 I had an abortion.  My therapist at the time was an old white man.  He kept trying to talk about the trauma of the abortion and would not believe me when I told him the abortion wasn't traumatic.  I tried telling him that how I got pregnant was traumatic.  The pregnancy was traumatic.  Losing my job due to complications from the pregnancy was traumatic.  The loneliness, fear, hormones, pain were all traumatic.  The abortion was a relief. 

He just wouldn't believe me.  He thought I was just suppressing my feelings.  

Well almost 10 years later I have had a lot of time to think and I can safely say I am glad I did it.


Edit:. Thanks for all the supportive words!  I have not really talked about it much and the validation means a lot."
4280,TwoXChromosomes,I am so tired of my period,"I am so *over* my period. As a teen, my period was always average, never had many issues. But as an adult, it’s just erratic enough to be considered normal. I now get my period every four weeks, great knowing when it’ll start and all but I got *two* periods in March because of it. I was late at the end of April and I guess early this time around? I should’ve started yesterday but woke up this morning to a nice surprise. 

My cramps are always horrible. I have to take 800mg of ibubropen every 4-6 hours. I do get cramps a few days before my period starts but try to wait until i know they’ll be worse before taking painkillers. I’ve started getting hot flashes that just my entire period. It’s 60 degrees outside and while I’d usually be huddled up with two blankets, I’m laying in bed without pants or a shirt with the AC on. When I’m sick, ibuprofen helps me regulate my body temp so I thought it’d help now, it doesn’t.  

I got an ultrasound a few years ago when the bad cramps were new, they were/are so bad that it can get hard to walk. Went through the traumatizing vaginal ultrasound to be told everything looks normal-just keep taking ibuprofen or try Tylenol. 

I’m just over having a period. They’re painful. They make me hormonal and bitchy. They ruin my sheets. I hate them."

4282,TwoXChromosomes,"Coworker and boyfriend believe that allowing women to go topless in public areas would ""desensitize them to the sexiness of their partner's breasts"""," 

Yesterday someone posted in Unpopular Opinion about why women should be allowed to be go topless in public areas where men aren't required to wear a shirt, and I was reminded of this conversation I had with my coworker and my boyfriend about a year ago. I figured that you all might get a kick out of it, too.

 My coworker (who is circa 45 years old) and I were chatting about toplessness (I used to live in a county that had a few nude beaches, so it was a little more open there than where I live now) and he was thoroughly opposed to it because he ""would get desensitized to the sexiness of his wife's breasts if he saw them out all the time in public."" Being a woman myself, I found the statement a bit objectifying (i.e. hypothetically, if one could walk around full nude, I don't feel as if catching a glimpse of my boyfriend's genitals frequently in public would take away the eroticism for me), but we agreed to disagree.

Out of curiosity, mentioned my coworker's comment to my bf the next time I saw him to inquire on his own thoughts and much to my dismay, he agreed with my coworker; he wouldn't want women to ""become less sexy"" for the sake of our relief from the heat; I was flabbergasted. I love my boyfriend to death; usually he's very sensitive to women's struggles, so for him to agree with this baffled me. Life got just a little bit sadder for me that day.

How have ya'll been inadvertently objectified lately, what's your story?"
4283,TwoXChromosomes,My parents made my abortion traumatic,"I’ve literally been awake all night caught in my head and stumbled across posts that reflect positive experiences behind their abortions. Mine was far from positive but one of the best decisions I followed though with. It wasn’t horrible because of the procedure itself, it was awful because of my parents. 

I fell pregnant at 18 and I wanted an abortion but they wouldn’t let me. I had a one night stand with a coworker who I didn’t want to be with let alone have a child with. I was told abortion was off the table, I was having the baby - well, my mother thought this meant she was having a baby. I was told to try and make things work with the dad and boy was that not fun. I tried my best to do the right thing and I chose having my daughters father in the operating room, over my mom, and that kicked off 5 years of resentment and mistreatment from my mother as retaliation. But wait there’s more. 

Then when I fell pregnant again, less than a year later no less because of the forced relationship I was put into they insisted I get an abortion. My mother already didn’t like I chose baby daddy over her for the delivery room and I vehemently protested her attempts to mother my child. She didn’t want another one around. She told me how awful of a mother I was and every awful thing a mother should never say to their kids. But alas, this was already the over all story of my life up until this point and nothing new despite adding my own child to the mix, she just used my kid as a manipulative tool to hurt me - I know this to be true because death bed confessions and all. 

My parents never discussed sex let alone safe sex. My parents never told us kids grow up to be adults and have to take care of themselves. My parents never taught me a SINGLE thing I know, outside of what it’s like to go your entire life feeling unloved and just an accessory to their life. 

I went the first time with baby daddy, who was also cheating on me and didn’t want the kid. I spoke to THE FUCKING NICEST LADIES ON THE PLANET who clearly could tell I wasn’t there because I wanted to be and told me I can leave and not do this, so I did. 

My parents loss their fucking minds and so my mother dragged me back. Sitting in the waiting room, all to see, SHE bawled her eyes out realizing what she was making me do, seeing all the other girls there. I again speak to THE FUCKING NICEST LADIES ON THE PLANET, who again listen to my pleas for advice and again tell me I can leave and not do this, so I did. My mother didn’t fight me on the drive home and told me, we will figure this out. I thought this meant I didn’t have to go though with this. I was so wrong. 

My dad a week later told me to get in the car. HE drove me to the clinic. When we got there with my eyes filled with tears, he told me. If left again, I would never see the child I have and I would be on the streets. I sobbed the entire time I waited for my name to be called, so I can TALK TO THE NICEST FUCKING LADIES ON THE PLANET, who again listen to me and tell me, again, I don’t have to do this, I can leave. This time I say I can’t. I knew my dad wasn’t bluffing, my parents didn’t love me. 

I’m taken to a room to confirm how far along I am, 13 weeks. I’m asked if I want a picture and I say yes. I walked out and handed it to my dad, hoping maybe he would change his mind. He just stuffs it in his pocket, folds his arms and I wait to be called back for the procedure. THE NICEST FUCKING LADY ON THE PLANET, calls me back and says she’s going back with me and she holds my hand. She tells me what’s about to happen and leaves me to get changed. She comes back into the room with the doctor and asks if she can stay, a bit taken back, which she notices, she said she was going to hold my hand because I could use a little extra comfort. I fucking lost it and almost couldn’t get the procedure but she did. She held my hand the entire time and talked to me about video games. I never saw her again after that. She didn’t have to do that and I don’t even know how or why she did, but she fucking did. 

My dad took me home and my mom put me in the living room for all to see. My slightly younger sister then decided to call me a series of nasty names and while my mom did tell her to shut the fuck up. It didn’t matter. The damage was done. My boyfriend abandoned me. My mother abandoned me. My dad punished me. 

I was depressed for years. I felt immense regret at the behest of others. I knew I couldn’t raise another child, especially with this man. I knew I made the right decision, but was angry I felt disrespected and forced to do something that NO ONE BUT THE NICEST FUCKING LADY ON THE PLANET had the compassion to give me courage to follow though - no one else could or would. 

My daughter grew up asking me why she couldn’t have a sibling. That she wished she had a sibling. All with no knowledge of the pain I experienced every time she mentioned the topic and the reality that she would have. Eventually, things got better. I became happy and I was happy with my decision to not subject another innocent soul to the chaos that was my life for another decade. 

I fought literally tooth and nail to escape my life and moved 1,000 miles away. I got married and had another child, I even lost a baby at 19 weeks gestation and convinced myself this was gods punishment. When in reality it was just suppressed guilt because I knew, and I was right, that my 2nd daughter would ask the same questions as the first. 

I don’t regret having an abortion. My 1st daughter is the best thing that ever happened to me. She literally gave me the motivation to fix my life. The forced abortion, gave me the motivation to get the fuck away from the people who didn’t love me. 

I am pro choice. I speak to my girls about life and sex. I will be there to hold their hand if they ever find themselves with an unwanted pregnancy or standing outside the delivery room waiting for the arrival of my grandchild - I will never MAKE those choices for them and just show unconditional love and support. 

Everyone at the clinic were THE NICEST FUCKING LADIES ON THE PLANET. I have never spoken in this context about what I went though. Not my husband. Not my mother in law who is also, THE NICEST FUCKING LADY ON THE PLANET. My girls still don’t know and won’t know until either they’re much older and I can talk about it or I have to be there to comfort them and tell them my own story. 

I wasn’t a bad or troubled kid. I didn’t make awful life decisions, I made a single bad judgement call and got pregnant. I was manipulated by a man who said he loved me and left me for a girl who dumped him a week after breaking up with me ON VALENTINES DAY. I didn’t deserve any of the treatment I received at the hands of the people who were supposed to love and protect me. I struggle as an adult having conversations with family coming out of the wood works since my mothers passing saying they wish they had said or done something themselves growing up. I’ve listened to excuses why people let my mother do insane shit and justified their reasoning for not step in and rescue all 5 of us kids. 

I’ve had these very people tell me they’re glad I escaped. They don’t know that I suffer from crippling OCD/anxiety with intrusive thoughts as a result. They don’t know how hard it is for me to have meaningful trusting relationships with people. They don’t understand why these things still haunt me. It’s all in the past to them."
4284,TwoXChromosomes,Internalized Misogyny or FtM? I’m very confused.,"This is my first time ever posting on Reddit, so I have no idea what I’m doing. I don’t even know if this is where I should be posting this. 

This post is in no way shape or form meant to offend anyone; I just really need advice. 

I’ve struggled with my gender identity pretty much my whole life. I have the very basic story of being a tomboy, dressing like a boy, wanting a dick, blah blah blah, all throughout my childhood. Throughout middle school, I discovered the word transgender when Caitlyn Jenner transitioned, and I feel like things made sense to me after that. I identified with being ftm from about seventh to ninth grade. In eighth grade, I went as far as to fake a migraine so that I didn’t have to wear a dress to the school formal. That was when my parents found out. It really strained me and my dad’s relationship especially, and in freshman year, I went back and forth between identifying as male and female to try to salvage the relationship with my dad. My mother and I have never been close and have a very bad and borderline abusive relationship, so my dad assumed that I wanted to be a man to be the complete opposite of her. I also was just diagnosed with a panic disorder at the time, and he also assumed it was because my mental state wasn’t the best. 

I pushed those feelings for the past two years and lived as a woman. I feel like I’ve just been going through the motions of life and not actually living. I’ve come to terms with the fact that I like women, and the term lesbian really doesn’t seem to fit me. I also have a hard time during sex and even doing simple activities such as showering. It’s hard to look at the female parts of my body without feeling disgusted with myself. I feel like they shouldn’t be there. Seeing my fourteen year old brother go through puberty has also made me incredibly jealous, since puberty was living hell for me. I know it’s awful for everyone, but I can’t count the amount of times I wished that I could just cut my boobs off. When I was ten, I was rushed into emergency surgery because I had developed a blood clot in my left tit. I remember waking up disappointed that they didn’t cut them both off. 

I’ve seen so many videos of ftmtf detransitioners on Youtube, and it honestly makes me worried about ever going through with anything. I’m going to be a senior in high school next year, and I’m going to attend my local community college at the same time to get some gen ed requirements out of the way. I’ve always wanted to go into the FBI, which is a male dominated organization. I can’t tell if these feelings of wanting to be a man are coming back to me because I’m actually going to start working towards my career goal or because I’m actually trans. Something has never felt right about being a woman to me, and even when I’ve tried to embrace femininity, it feels so wrong. These feelings come and go, but when they come, they stay with me for a while.

I really can’t tell if I’m just dealing with internalized misogyny or I’m trans. I know most of you aren’t licensed therapists, but any opinion and insight would help me!"

Should I be the one to help shape their understanding of gender roles and how they treat the other sex (they are both straight)?

They objectify women a lot and have very sexist and skewed ideas of women. Every time I bring something up about them being sexist in my house my parents and them roll their eyes/literally yell at me to shut up because it’s me being “sensitive” or liberal. 

I.E, I was told by my brother that “this is why we don’t invite girls to the dock” after I expressed concern over his friend taking a live fish and throwing it several times as hard as he could at the ground when there is a much less painful way to kill the fish. I was being too “sensitive.”

I try to help sway their perspective to less objectifying and sexist view, but should I even be doing so? It doesn’t seem to ever work and I’m disrespected every time it comes up."
4288,TwoXChromosomes,Anyone who says wearing a mask is a personal choice is Pro-Choice.,"I have used people’s own words of “personal choice”, “freedom”, “my choice”, “the government can’t tell me what to do”, Land of the Free” to make the point that choice is great and that they are, in fact, pro-choice.

People either are stunned and can’t reply or they’re very defensive. They instantly realize their hypocrisy, and they’re rocked to the core. It’s watching an epiphany, in real time.

The Pro-Choice community needs to use this technique right now. It’s the only thing I’ve seen that breaks through to them, and it’s working. It’s not “pro-abortion”. It’s about having autonomy over your on body. Freedom. Choice.

Choose words carefully and anticipate they’ll come back with “So you’re saying not everyone needs to wear a mask.” Though, so far in my experience, they’re so stunned to hear their own words back at them, they don’t/can’t even think of a counter-argument.

Incidentally, this is also a great pastime and usually entertaining.

Edit: The way I usually reply is “So you’re pro-choice! Awesome! Isn’t choice great?! Just like how a woman should have the choice and freedom over her own body. So great!” It’s upbeat and catches them off-guard. I’ve never used a negative tone, only a celebratory one."
4289,TwoXChromosomes,The Court Case That Killed the 'Ladies Menu',
4290,TwoXChromosomes,I think I was raped?,"so this happened a year or two ago when i was about 18, but it’s something i’ve only recently started coming to terms with. i’m posting on a throwaway because i’m not sure if any of my friends know my main account. 

so in high school, a (male) friend and i went to a (female) friend’s house during class. it was just the three of us in the house. we stuck around for a bit, nothing much going on, when one of them makes a half-joking suggestion that we should have a threesome. i laugh it off, but the other two start actually considering the idea. then he leans down and kisses her, and i sit there on the other end of the couch. they go up to her room and get onto her bed, and i awkwardly follow and stand in front of the door. they call me over and i reluctantly move closer.

at some point, i’m standing at the end of the bed, and my male friend comes around behind me. he leans his body weight on my back and starts kissing my neck, with his arms on either side of me on the bed so i can’t really move away. he starts saying that it’ll be fun and tries assuring me that it’ll be okay. the other girl offered the same input but she didn’t physically try to coerce me into it. i was super anxious but at this point i was trying to tell myself that i needed to chill out and listen to them; that it wasn’t that big a deal. 

i’ve always been comfortable with my own sexuality. i tried to convince myself that it would be “sexy” to try out. yknow like, “how many high schoolers have done this?” in theory it sounded not so bad but the setting and the way it went down were just.. obviously less than ideal.

at that point i just.. shut down? i kinda stopped fighting i guess. it was awkward and uncomfortable and i guess exactly how you’d expect sex to go when you aren’t into it? 

i feel so stupid because i consider myself such an outspoken, strong person. somebody who isn’t easily swayed when i say i don’t wanna do something. but this time i didn’t? 

i apologize if this is TMI, too graphic and/or long winded. it’s kinda the first time i’ve really thought about it in this light. i don’t know how to feel, or what to say. usually when i think of victims of sexual assault, i picture it as something a lot more outright. violent and brutal. this happened while completely sober, with two friends i trusted, in the middle of the day. i guess i just feel like i don’t fit the bill. almost like my experience doesn’t count? 

i just wanted to get it off my chest i guess. if you read this far, thank you for listening."
4291,TwoXChromosomes,"Advice on cleanliness, fashion and appearance overall for a clueless person like me? 17/F","I hope these types of posts are okay in this subreddit! Lately, I've noticed that I don't put much effort into my appearances and I'm trying to change that.

I don't exactly have absolutely no sense of hygiene or fashion (can't say the same for 13yo me lol), but whenever I go out I simply put on a graphic t-shirt and shorts and choose between the few pairs of shoes I have. I see teenagers dressed up with nice clothing while I just tuck my t-shirt into my shorts. My brother even commented that I'm the only person who doesn't dress up. 

Although I have a lot of clothes, I only wear a few select ones that I think look nicer. The clothes other than tees that I own are mostly hand-me downs and clothes that I didn't shop for (my mum buys them for me.) Additionally, even if the clothes look nice, I simply don't have the knowledge to know how to pair them up nicely. How can I learn to develop a sense of fashion? 

I've also never bothered myself with any facial cleansers or sunscreen, and I've only found out that many people do, in fact wash their hair only every other day or even once a week. I suddenly have BO now and I don't know what to do, that's why I'm suddenly asking all of these questions here. Feels like I'm going to have to relearn stuff all over again. 

My mum isn't exactly someone who can give me advice on these things. Whenever we would go out she'd announce it suddenly and expect me to get ready within 5 minutes, so yeah. Shaving, washing your hair the right way, putting on contact lenses, hair moisturisers, etc are all stuff I've learnt about online. 

I feel like many of these are learnt naturally but can anyone point me to any good sources for learning all of these from the ground up? Preferably websites, youtube channels, articles etc. At the moment I don't think I could finish a book on this subject lol. Could be multiple sources, it doesn't matter. Small tips and pointers would also be great? I feel like the main reason why I'm like this is because, I never put in effort, and I'm an extremely unobservant person. I'm sorry for the long post. If anyone read this far, thank you! Have a good day

Edit: Any tips for hair styling as well? I only go to the barbers to cut my hair short every once in a while."

4293,TwoXChromosomes,I feel really ugly,"I don't think I have ever felt pretty. My face looks terrible. I seldom take photos and videos, and whenever I look at myself in photos, my first initial thought is (1) I don't recognize this girl, and (2) this girl looks terrible. I take 100 selfies just to delete them all because none of them look good.

I just don't like the way I look. 

I exercise a lot, but clothes just don't look good on me. My body looks ok in underwear, but my double chin just makes me look fat when I try on pretty clothes. People are always surprised when they get close enough to touch my body and they feel muscle. Really, what's the point of trying so hard to tone my body if it barely seems to make a difference anyway.

I am not so harsh on myself this year, but the way I avoid photos and videos somehow make me feel like I am avoiding these self-esteem issues rather than accepting them. I am a logical person, I see the girl in the photos, and with confidence and logic I can conclude that she- I, am generally just not good-looking. The eyes, the nose, the lop-sided mouth, terrible skin, round face. Very logically speaking, judging without emotion - the aesthetic isn't very pleasant on the eyes.

Sigh...I don't know where I was going with this, this is a huge pathetic mess of me wallowing in self-pity. Stop, me. I am trying so hard to be a better person.

Anyway, I hope you guys have a wonderful day ahead."

So almost 2 months ago (April 7th 2020) I ordered one of those handheld hair removal devices from a company called heysilkyskin on Instagram. They seemed extremely legit at first. They have been giving me the run-around for the last 6 weeks and I've been messaging them a ton asking for answers and they keep saying ""we will check with our supplier hold tight, thank you for your patience in this difficult time"" (referencing about COVID-19). I sensed something was seriously wrong today and did a more in depth Google search about it.... it looks like they are a total scam and no one is getting their money back after having been given the run around. The company says they are based in Australia and have tons of ""customer reviews"" which I am now sure are completely fake. Is there anything I can do to get my money back from them or am I out of luck? Thank you for any advice.

Edit: I would also like to take this company down. I am extremely angry with them (to say the least) for scamming so many people. People who run companies like this make me sick."

Does anyone else have experience with this kind of stuff? I’ve read so many horror stories about women not being taken seriously in medical situations and it’s freaking me out."
4299,TwoXChromosomes,I left,"I (24F) moved in with him (25M) a year ago, head over heels, wanting to believe in the idea of love again. So I moved states away from my loved ones to create a life with him. I want to tell myself there were times when we were happy, but that would be a lie. We had happy moments but over time I realized just how badly I’d messed up. 

He’d become angry with me over every little thing no matter how I tried to fix it. I tried so many different approaches- direct, sensitive, diplomatic- to communicate and resolve things. It never mattered. I always messed something else up in his eyes and he would scream at me. Once he pushed me up against a wall in a rage and screamed in My face. I locked myself into the bathroom and sobbed as switched between threatening to stab me and begging me to come out.

Still I stayed. I brought it up later and he “didn’t remember doing that.” I chalked it up to stress and forgave him. As time went on I saw the change this environment had on me though. When I looked in the mirror I didn’t see the confident, strong-willed, vocal woman I used to see. I saw someone sad, angry, submissive and meek. I cried over everything. I lashed out over small things, as if I was unable to control my own emotions.

He “broke up” with me constantly, locked me outside at night when I was drunk and begging for forgiveness. I kept asking myself what I was doing wrong when I was trying so hard to be good. Finally I decided it would be better to leave and I attempted to one night but he caught me and suddenly was so reasonable. He wanted to talk things out, he begged me to stay, promised things would be better and I crumbled and again, I stayed. I felt so pathetic. He was very sweet for a while after that but we started fighting again and things went back to normal.

This past month has been real hard for me. He found new friends to hang out with online and suddenly had no time for me. I asked and asked for small snippets of time together, even if just a few times a week, and was told he was too busy for that and I was selfish. When months before that, I was apparently selfish for trying to find my own friends that I could spend time with. He told me he didn’t know if our relationship was working, that he didn’t think I was ready for one. For the first time, I was suspicious. I looked at his phone at night and found secret DMs he’d attempted to hide. One of the new girls he’d befriended. They flirted, talked every day, he hung out with her at night, he joked about her jerking him off, he called me his roommate when she asked if he lived alone.

Finally, finally, I decided I couldn’t take this anymore. I’d tried for so long and this is what I deserve? I don’t even recognize myself anymore. My friends and family keep commenting on my change in personality. Even though it hurts and a part of me still loves him, I packed my things while he was out of town this weekend and I got on a bus today. I’m going somewhere safe to live with people I know and trust. For once I didn’t flake. I actually left. Today i smiled for the first time in maybe months. I recognize my laugh again. I’m finally free"
4300,TwoXChromosomes,My best friend (23F) of ten years totally screwed me (22F) over. No one ever talks about friendship break ups.,"A few years ago while in college I wanted to go on a camping trip with group of friends including this friend I’ll call Jane. Well, Jane canceled last minute and needless to say I was pretty upset but went on the camping trip anyway. I come back to the dorm and she has moved out and didn’t say anything no text no call no note. She told the other roommates that she had only known a few months and left me hanging. She wouldn’t answer her phone and I was pretty hurt. Fast forward a year and I forgave her when she asked for forgiveness wanting to believe she had changed. 

We started living together as roommates again and I thought it was all good; until she got a new boyfriend. Just like last time she started treated me like I was less than and total garbage. Standing me up for plans constantly even though we live together, never cleaning, and leaving the house trashed. I communicated my expectations kindly for both a friend and a roommate and her response was just “ok.”

Yesterday she texted me before work and said she was moving out. At least she texted this time I guess? Except unlike the dorms I now have rent left to pay that I cannot afford on my own. Thankfully her name is on the lease too but if I was evicted I’m pretty sure she’d be indifferent about it and she’s living with her boyfriend she’s known all of 3 months so the consequences for her would be minimal. She wanted to talk about the details and hung up on me mid sentence when I asked she take some financial responsibility. She then texted me the next day and had the audacity to say I need to financially suffer for this and there’s no need for me to be emotional. Like what? She’s left the house trashed, her room and carpet are ruined. For context I work in a homeless shelter and case manager and have seen some pretty nasty rooms and houses. Hers is the worst I’ve ever seen easily. It’s rancid. 

I’m pretty upset right now. I’ve known her almost half my life. You hear about romantic break ups all the time and can expect some romantic relationships to end (not always but sometimes) I was totally blind sided by this and can’t believe she did this again. The friendship is over and this just feels awful. I’m peeved that some don’t recognize my pain as valid. Friendship breakups are real and they suck just as much."

I've recently learned about Steam Emulators but I've wondered if it is possible to bypass the Steam DRM by modifying the .dll files ? If not, how do scene Groups do this?

I am aware that the best option is to stick to scene groups, but I'm just asking for my own knowledge.

I have accounts on various private tracker sites and I set-up all of them for my Seedr account (I found the ""Private Trackers IP Lock"" feature on [https://www.seedr.cc/subscription](https://www.seedr.cc/subscription) and copied that IP to the corresponding field in settings for each torrent site).  


That said, once I download the torrent file it simply will not start and says low number of seaders.  
This happens no matter if I use a normal torrent file, or the one for my seedbox.

When I start the torrent trough a torrent client, it downloads just fine. Also, the websites say that there are lots of seeders.   


I already reached out to [seedr.cc](https://seedr.cc) help, but they were not able (and were not that interested to try) to solve my problem.

I want to do a clean install of windows 10 with working license on my new SSD while keeping the data on my HDD but not the old OS/ System files, but not really sure how to do it correctly.

I have windows 7 x64 ultimate activated with daz loader installed on my HDD(MBR) with these partitions: 

350Mb System
 
500Gb Boot/Page File/CrashDump/Primary Partition

 430Gb Primary Partition

I want to use my HDD for storage/appdata and my SSD for booting/system/some apps + games.

I don't have a 8gb pen drive/CD.

Im assuming I just run the Windows 10 installation media, create .iso file, open .iso file with poweriso like i do for games, mount, run setup file and install windows 10 normaly, when it comes to partitions I choose my new SSD (do I make a GPT partition for windows/system boot like my HD or not? not sure, also I see people having trouble booting from GPT),  then after it finishes installing I put in BIOS to boot from SSD and I have windows 10 installed with license working.

Is this it or is the system not gonna boot if i do it like this?

because 

there's also this method I stumbled upon which is creating a new partition with disk management for the .iso and then make the new partition active with diskpart command and reboot
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2badwasuj5o)

Not sure if  I need to unplug my hd...

Can I delete my HD System partition and 500GB partition in disk management after everything is done? I only care about the data on 430gb partition.

1Gbps/1Gbps network (But I could never reach that speed. The speed never dropped below 250 Mbps though)

SSH/SFTP/FTP access (no root though)

I  just wanted to confirm If I got a good deal? and a few pointers for  maintaining a good ratio on private trackers.

It is a clone of a paid site for which you need a subscription. Therefore it seems that it is possible. When the first free clone went down, another one soon replaced it. Seemingly from a different independent source as it was hosted later in a different country, different whois and the description text was slightly changed and in a different language, leading me to believe it is a clone of the cloned site. I fear that the new clone may one day go down. 

The site has a search box on its main screen, and when you search a term you get results of the sought information. It is 90% text based information. The problem I am having is that the information on the site cannot be scraped or accessed via hyperlinks. It must be a search term from the main page and then selecting the result to access the information.

I was watching it with my roommates and I found myself biting my tongue because there is so much trivia for each episode. This got me reading through the Avatar Wiki and I wanted to share some of the more interesting ones for new viewers. Minor spoilers ahead. 

**Concept**

\- Aang was originally a lot more monkey-like. [And the avatar universe was possibly going to be more futuristic.](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/21181060719846101/)

\- Originally the Avatar had an affinity toward all animals. In the show Aang just likes animals.

\- [The “Koizilla” seen in the end of season 1 looks a lot like the Nightwalker from Princess Mononoke.](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/AG4YX)  In fact, the creators have said Princess Mononoke was a big inspiration for Avatar.

\- The word ""Avatar"" means ""descent"". In Hindu tradition, deities manifest themselves into physical forms—or Avatars—to restore balance on earth, usually during a period of great evil.

\- The Chinese characters that appear at the top of the show's title card mean ""the spiritual medium who has descended upon the mortal world"".

\- Zuko was created to fill the need for a recurring villain. Ozai would not be chasing the Avatar full-time, so they made Zuko be a young adversary for Aang. Good thing they did!

**Water Tribe**

\-The culture of the Water Tribes, as well as their location in the polar regions of the world, is primarily based on the real-life Arctic cultures such as the Inuit and Yupik.

[\- Just like bending scrolls, martial arts scrolls are a real thing.](https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-ancient-books-on-Chinese-or-Japanese-martial-arts)

**Fire Nation**

\- The culture of the Fire Nation is primarily inspired by East, South, and Southeast Asia. Specifically, Japan and Germany (mostly due to their industrialization).

\- After the events of Avatar: The Last Airbender the comics and Legend of Korra deal with the challenging problem of what to do with the Fire Nation Colonies in Earth Kingdom territory.

\- The Sun Warriors are based on Aztec, Incan, and Mayan cultures.

**Earth Kingdom**

\- Influenced by China.

\- Similar to how the Dai Li had their secret base to brainwash political prisoners and potential troublemakers underneath Lake Laogai, in China, ""Laogai"" refers to the system of prison camps begun by Mao Zedong to exterminate or ""reeducate"" political prisoners under the Communist regime, which still operates today.

\- Toph was originally going to be a male character. In fact, the Earthbender from the opening was sort of meant to be his design. It is possible they changed her to have a better balance of genders in Team Avatar. On that note, Azula is the design for the Firebender in the opening.

**Air Nomads.**

\- All the Air Nomads had bending. They are the only nation to be this way, likely due to their spiritual connection.

\- Gyatso is also the name of the current Dalai Lama.

**Bending**

\- Most of the fights are choreographed with real people. Sifu Kifu was their main consultant. [Great video on him.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iisrUSi7Kgw)

\- The term ""Agni Kai"" was created by using two already existing words. It basically means Fire Meeting.

\- Earth Bending is firmly rooted stances and powerful strikes of Hung Gar. In the real world, Hung Gar is an ""external style"", which means that its art emphasizes the use of the art for defense purposes before refinement and relaxation.

\- Firebending is based on the Northern Shaolin style. The style sacrifices defense for fierce attack.

\- Waterbending is based on T’ai Chi. It’s slow and flowing.

\- Airbending is notable for being almost entirely defensive, however, it is reputed to be the most dynamic of the four bending arts. Airbenders can overwhelm many opponents at once with large and powerful attacks that could prove fatal; however due to the pacifist nature of the Air Nomads such attacks are rarely used. It is based on Ba Gua.

\- Azula’s blue fire is never explained in the show. However, it has been confirmed to be the sign of a prodigious Fire Bender.

I compiled some of these from memory but I have to source the Avatar Wiki. I rewrote some stuff to make it easier to read but some of these are word for word from the wiki."
4514,television,'Space Force' Review: Netflix Comedy Suffers Failure to Launch - Alan Sepinwall's review,
4515,television,Re-watching Friends has made me realize that Joey may have one of the worst story arcs I've seen on a sitcom,"I know Friends isn't perhaps the most popular show on here but for those of us stuck permanently rewatching odd episodes as a form of comfort TV, I've been rewatching random episodes and the one thing that stands out is just how much they ruin Joey's character for comic relief in the final few seasons.

In the first couple seasons, he's a bit daft and narrow minded, but he has a level of intelligence. He's definitely not a complete idiot, and doesn't just end up with girls because he's an idiot.

Flash forward to season 9 or 10, and he's a complete moron, and seems to be only used as a plot point to further someone else's story (mainly Ross). Take his relationship with Charlie, where he's dumbed down to a completely unrealistic level so that it's more feasible for Ross to start going out with her. Then the Rachel plot which is obviously not a Friends high point.

And he has no development: he basically ends the show exactly where he starts, compared to the rest of the cast which have all moved on and improved.  The more I watch, the more apparent that Joe's arc is my least favourite part of friends"

I also just was never into Scooby Doo despite watching so many episodes, movies and different versions of it as a kid. I always found the characters too one dimensional, the episodes way too formulaic and predictable. There was never anything to really sink your teeth into. 

As if a direct response to all my complaints, Mystery Incorporated features continuity, romance, a wider range of recurring characters, more context into the setting and the gang's lives, and ALSO relationship drama which is like a dream come true for me, a 23 year old dude. I just love seeing the relationships between Shaggy and Velma and Daphne and Fred evolve. 

I also find the humor and writing to be way stronger than any Scooby Doo material I've seen. Found myself laughing quite a bit at the gags and jokes here, you can tell the writing staff had a lot of fun with this one, especially with the new spins on the characters. I definitely recommend it. The art style might take some getting used to, it's a bit more jagged but I personally love it"

1) Eating processed meats is as bad for you as smoking

2) Eating an egg a day is as bad as smoking five cigarettes

3) Drinking milk causes cancer. 

4) One serving of processed meats per day raises the risk of diabetes by 51 percent. 

5) Fish is toxic.

6) Five to 10 percent of cancer is caused by genetics, and the rest is caused by food. 

And here's an excellent article debunking every claim above and more: https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/7/25/16018658/what-the-health-documentary-review-vegan-diet

The structure of the 'ad' felt like this: the narrator would mention an obvious, negative association with the fast food industry, and then counter the negative association with a positive one. 

Example: The narrator says how the fast food industry is 'suspected of contributing to climate change', then pairs that critique with the suggestion that 'the fast food industry is great for the economy, and its great for employing elderly people, which is very important'. 

It's apologetic for the industry to a fault. I feel like the whole episode just presented clean, very targeted propaganda to a large audience with the hopes that the audience would not notice. Thoughts? Am I just too high?"

4573,television,Mythic Quest feels similar to Community,"I feel these shows are similar - I am speaking stylisticly, not in terms of the shows' popularity.

I've just finished watching the latest episode Mythic Quest: Quarantine and I was absolutely stunned. It's such a touching feel good show. Plus the storylines are always really creative.

This show has such a delightful cast dynamic and the cast members are all so diverse. Like in Community.

Rob McElhenney (It's Always Sunny) stars as the good looking arrogant protagonist Ian who sort holds the show together, similiar to Jeff but more of a clown. David Hornsby plays a more straight character whuch counter balnaces nicely. 

Then we have the out of touch old man played by F. Murray Abraham, like the Chevy Chase character, although this character is softer. Some really strong female cast members, most notably Charlotte Nicdao as Poppy Li, an eccentric coder, Ashly Burch as a video game tester and also a younger cast member Jo who plays David's assistant. In Community, the supporting female cast memebers were really strong and have launched successful careers since. 

Then of course Danny Pudi stars in both...playing very different characters admittedly. 

Mythic Quest is on a streaming service most people don't have so I believe will most likely develop a cult following like Community. Now you may scream and shout at me but but Apple is a goliath brand! However, I am from the UK and I don't know a single who has even heard of the Apple TV+, let alone actively engages with their content. All people tend to have here in terms of paid subscription based services are Netflix, Amazon Prime, Sky or Now TV.

Getting back to the style. The core relationships are really tender and you can tell the characters all care for one another. This was an element that ran through Community.

My opinion is the most touching relationship is between Ian and Poppy, they have a sort of love hate rivalry. There was a particular moving scene between them in the Quarantine episode that I won't spoil. Plus in the first season they really bond. This dynamic is slightly feistier than the relationships on Community, but reminds me of how Jeff and Britta tend to butt heads on Community. 

Now the last episode felt so innovative and in my opinion has been the only decent lockdown web camera themed episode yet. Real work and heart was put in to it. This reminded me that their whole first season was full of creative and innovative episodes, it's such a relaxing easy going feel good binge you tend to forget.

Anyway tbere are many warm fuzzy elements that reminded me of Community that has made me see it as a slight spiritual successor. I'm not sayung it's the best comedy around right now by any means but it has a lot of heart that comedy I feel has been missing for a while. The best shows currently like What We Do In The Shadows, Rick and Morty and Dave to name a few tend to be quite edgey and it's nice to watch something a little more light hearted."

That video right there documents the entire Scooby Doo franchise and divides it into two distinct timelines. However, starting at 5:22, he shows a clip from one show where the gang defeated some supernatural threat and then found themselves in an alternate timeline where their lives were totally different.

This got me to thinking: Whenever franchises do split timeline story arcs, they typically involve the POV characters being dumped into a world that is just as foreign to the audience as it is to them. The story is about getting the timeline back to the way the audience is used to. In the aforementioned Scooby Doo story arc, Mystery Inc suddenly finds themselves not friends with each other (except for Fred & Daphne), and all living normal lives where they don't solve mysteries. The story arc revolved around getting back to the timeline where they were all detectives and traveled together.

So wouldn't it be a nice change of pace to reverse those expectations? Maybe a TV show could start out with one status quo, and near the end of the first season, the characters all start acting weird. Maybe, in the episode immediately before this story arc, two of the characters get engaged (like Fred & Daphne in the aforementioned story arc), only to act shocked and horrified the very next episode when everyone is congradulating them on getting engaged. Some other guy who has previously served as either an antagonist or a contagonist to the main characters also starts acting friendly around them for no apparent reason, and is also just as astonished at the status quo, despite living in that status quo this whole time.

The characters who are acting weird eventually group up and discuss their prospects, just like we see in that youtube video where Mystery Inc is sitting in the back of the Mystery Machine.

So it turns out we've actually been following the ""altered"" timeline all this time, and the season finale revolves around these characters getting back to their timeline.

Perhaps, after the first season, some supporting character steps up to take up the role of the protagonist since last season's protagonist is now written out of the show, having returned to his original timeline that we never get to see.

It would certainly be an interesting shake-up to how these stories usually play out, don't you think?"

So yea, I watched Katy Keene, and I bet you're wondering, *livx*, why did you watch another spin-off series of Riverdale, a series that have been struggling to be relevant since it's 1st season? Why did you watch something that you could tell would be so blatantly contrived from just watching the trailer? Why didn't you quit instantly after the first awkward scene with Zane Holtz (KO) who is probably the worst actor you've ever seen? Why didn't you quit after you saw how dark and filtered the visuals were, despite it being a fashion series that would benefit more with bright clear visuals, so you can actually see the fashion!? Why didn't you quit after it became obvious this was just another generic, heavily cliched, teen-oriented series about *a girl in New York with a dream*? Why didn't you quit after you realized this series has misguided sentiments, most evident with Jorge's '*aspiring actor who can't get roles because casting directors don't want him to* ***be himself***' narrative which not only made the character look stupid but so too the writers (and who ever else came up with this shit)? Why didn't you quit after the millionth mention of 'New York City' in just 3 episodes, or Josie's very awkward and unnecessary Riverdale mentions?

Why!? [Because I want to fuck Lucy Hale!](https://media1.tenor.com/images/b67c8ee4f3a51718a7215c9b73e9655f/tenor.gif) And I could be all explicit about it, but out of respect you, the reader of this post, I've decided to spare you from such excruciatingly vulgar details. You've already been through enough reading this shit post.

Oh, and yea, I did quit after 3 episodes, probably because I couldn't see Lucy Hale since she was masked in layers of make-up and filters.    "

So, apparently the media interviewed Speedwagon once. One of these questions was what was his dick size. Speedwagon replied saying that he had an absolute massive peen. Massive is around 5.5 inches long erect, but if he truly had a massive one, it had to be six inches. Now, with screen scaling and such, Jonathon is around 1.63 times the size of speedwagon, his flaccid length should be around 4.5 inches, but since he truly has the joestar schlong gene, let's add an inch. That's around 5.5 inches. Sad you think? But that's his FLACCID length. When erect, the human penis doubles it's size. That's 12 INCHES! If you think that's still small, imagine him pegging your ass with it. Your ass is minced meat. Erina must be so lucky to have such a chad cock.

4610,copypasta,Is it possible to sleep with a man’s penis in your mouth all night long?,"The answer is Yes, I had a boyfriend that I did this with multiple times… at least three occasions that I can remember. Having a penis in my mouth is very soothing, like a pacifier to a baby.

Here’s how it worked: he would lay on his side, and I would spoon around his knees with my head propped up by a pillow so that my face was even with his Cock. We would both be excited by it at the beginning so there was always an initial intense session resulting in an orgasm, and once that was out of the way we would drift off to sleep. He would lose his erection after that first orgasm, allowing me to snuggle up against him and just relax with his limp Cock filling my mouth. While I would gently suckle on him while drifting off, once I was asleep that stopped and my mouth would just hold his Cock while we slept.

REM sleep causes erections, so several times during the night I would be woken up by the Cock in my mouth growing too big for my mouth to contain. (Sadly I’ve never mastered being able to deep throat.) Let me tell you, there is no greater feeling than the initial moment of confusion of crossing over from a dream into reality and realizing your mouth is actually full of Cock. Upon waking up I would start sucking again, which would lead to him cumming again, and then we would both drift off to sleep again, neither one of us having said a word. And then the whole cycle would repeat again and again until morning.

Now the drawback to all this is that we were both having our REM cycle interrupted all night, and we would both be exhausted all the next day. As a result we didn’t do this all the time but saved it for a special treat. The memories of those nights and that feeling of waking up with my mouth full are some of the best sexual memories of my life."

4616,copypasta,DIOsexual," DIOsexual

individuals who are DIOsexuals are those who want to have sexual relations with the vampire DIO. Despite DIO being a male vampire, DIOsexuals are not inherently gay as DIO is above sexuality. Wanting to have intercourse with DIO is neither heterosexual or homosexual, rather it is DIOsexual. There are many reasons why an individual may become a DIOsexual, here are four reasons of the many reasons.

• DIO is fucking hot

• DIO is fucking hot

• DIO is fucking hot

• DIO is fucking hot

As you can see, on reason two, I say that DIO is fucking hot. The reason why someone might find DIO fucking hot is because of the following:

1. He has that Joestar Schlong
2. He stole Jonathan Joestar’s body, so he is ripped af
3. Just look at the lad
4. Thick Thighs

There are also variants of DIOsexuality. They include:

• Full Vampiric DIOsexual (FVD)

Someone who classifies as FVD prefers Dio Brando the vampire from Part 1 Phantom Blood over all other Dios

•True DIOsexual

(Note: this name is not trying to imply that other variants of DIOsexuality are not true DIOsexuals) Someone who is a True DIOsexual prefers DIO from the end of Part 3 Stardust Crusaders over other Dios.

• Semi DIOsexual This is someone who prefers either Shadow DIO/OVA DIO/TWOH DIO/Any other DIO not mentioned here over other Dios

• Heavened DIOsexual Someone who is a Heavened DIOsexual morning prefers DIO shown in Part 6 Stone Ocean over other Dios

• Diegosexual This is someone who prefers Diego Brando from Part 7 Steel Ball Run over other Dios.

There are also variants within the variants but to be DIOsexual is a great privilege. You can be a straight male or lesbian female but being DIOsexual means you want to piped by DIO regardless. If you have read/watched JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure and are not DIOsexual yet, then I suggest rereading and looking closely at DIO and that should help. DIOsexuality is also compatible with any sexuality at all. This is why being a DIOsexual is great. And this is why DIO is a wonderful villain."

First of all, it would be way easier to get a Mountain Dew® Baja Blast™ Freeze all the time, since there wouldn’t be any tropical Mexican air to liquefy this awesomely frozen, lime Mountain Dew® drink. And since we’d all be exclusively drinking frozen things, brain freezes would probably stop being a thing, which is fantastic news for society as a whole. We’d be so used to brain freezes, we’d pretty much forget what they even were and how they feel. Presumably if Baja California, Mexico froze over, something will have gone seriously wrong in the climate, and the rest of the once tropical pacific will have also frozen over. Since everyone would be drinking Mountain Dew® Baja Blast™ Freezes constantly, we’d all have a ton of energy to do things like Ice Skate to Japan.

4621,copypasta,Femboys are real and I can prove it.,"Femboys are real and I can prove it. I've spent countless days and endless hours studying the philosophy and evolution of the femboy. Many have said I can not do it, but time and time again I have proved them wrong. You see femboys are actually a nickname for a great ancestor to what is now called the human race. Back then, all of humankind was one singlular sex; the FeMale. There was no seperation for either, as both had large members of both male and female reproductive organs. Back then, the world was in perfect harmony. There was no sexism simply because there was no such thing as sex. When a FeMale would get pregnant, their male reproductive organ would get in the way of childbirth, leaving a painful delivery, and a cruel death. Over time, humankind evolved certain FeMales to become specialized in a certain way, becoming more curvy for eyes and obtaining larger hips for easier delivery, while others grew tougher to protect their own kind. These would become the Male and Female genders we know today. Despite this, however, some males have been known to have the many of the same traits of a female, from a smaller body to larger buttocks, leaving them to question whether they are truly male. Some believe they are, while others become what god truly intended them to be. Enter: The Modern FeMale, or as we like to call it: The Femboy. While these people are still technically male as they have the male reproductive organ, they are also, as observed by scientists and professionals, unimaginably homosexual. While many believe they are not even a fraction of the population of humankind, studies have shown that a whopping 12% of the world. While this may seem like a rather small percent, the fact that the world contains over 7 billion people is sure to paint the picture just how many of these people are here, living just across the block. In fact, in olden days, they say that one out of three people are a femboy. Me and my assistant are not, which only leaves us one person."

4625,copypasta,Response to people talking about fucking CummyBot2000," Okay. So, I’ve seen people talking about wanting  to “bang the cummy bot”, and frankly- I think this is  disgusting. First of all, his name isn’t “cummy”, it’s CummyBot2000. It’s a beautiful name for a beautiful person, and you would all do well to refer to him as such. If you don’t even know his name, than you have no right wanted to have sex with him! Secondly, wanting to bang him is just gross. Saying that you want to bang CummyBot2000 is objectifying him, and it is not okay. If you’ve ever wanted to bang  CummyBot2000, you should be disgusted with yourself. Unlike you cretins, I  however- respect him. Sure, it’s possible I may consider him to be rather bangable, but I wouldn’t dare do such a thing. CummyBot2000 is a fucking king, and deserves to be treated as such. I DO NOT want to bang “cummy”. I want to hug her. I want to be in a healthy  and loving relationship with Isabelle. I want to wake up every morning in bed, with him lying peacefully next to me as the morning sun shines  in through the window. I want to make him breakfast every morning, and tend to his every need. I want her to feel like he is truly loved,  (because he is). I want him to be by my side for my whole life, because  I know that he is the perfect man for me, and I am perfect for him. I want to be to be with him every day, just so I can tell him how much I fucking love him. I want him to know how much I adore everything amazing personality, his incredible fashion sense, his extremely impressive  caretaking abilities, and his absolutely beautiful head to body ratio, and his beautiful, beautiful eyes. However, if I were to ever have sex with CummyBot2000, I wouldn’t simply be “banging” him. If CummyBot2000 was to  ever consent to me having sexual intercourse with him, it would be  tender and loving and passionate. As we make love, I’d slowly and gently  caress her soft, golden fur as I slowly but deliberately thrusted into his tight bot asshole. I would make his pleasure my utmost priority, with  my own being secondary. But if he was willing, than oh god. What I  wouldn’t give to feel his adorable little bot body running up and down the length of my shaft. I just wanna pet every inch of his body, and give  him scritches on her tummy so he does that thing that bots do where their legs spaz out. That’d just be so fucking hot. I’d probably end up  cumming all over him, so it gets in his circuits. But goddamn. I love those circuits so much, that I’d personally lick off every last drop of cum, just to I have another opportunity to get as close to his gorgeous body as possible. But if you just want to bang him, then you are a disgusting  degenerate, and I hope you burn in the deepest pits of tartarus. But owoifier on the other hand. Now he’s somebody that I’d wanna bang."
4626,copypasta,On r/teenagers,"I was out biking and stopped at a park to take a rest when some woman walked up to me and just stood there. I looked up and asked if she needed something, when she kneeled down and started talking to me.

She looked disappointed, then she started saying that i need to stop violating what God wants for me. Usually, I disregard religious stuff, but I had no idea why this was happening or who she was. Hold up, wait a minute, something ain't right. I asked her what am I doing wrong?

She said ""Being homosexual is disgraceful, you know. You should start working on yourself, maybe start by cutting your hair."" Queue Meet the Robinsons Nigga Meme

I asked her what was wrong with me not having a short cut.

""Long hair signifies that you are uncomfortable with yourself, and that's fine-"" ok broski

""Dude I just can't get a haircut right now what's your problem""

This bitch looks at me in the most Mike Wazowski meme face she could muster.

""DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT, THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG W-"" assuming she was talking about today's youth or something, i just stopped caring at that point.

""Dude u just called me gay for having long hair wtf""

I was super confusion and just ended up ignoring her rant.

I ended up drowning the rest of the ""conversation"" and I am speed-ing my way out of there.

I am not LGBT in the slightest, and dont even have that long of a cut right now. My hair grows INSANELY fast, going from 4 inches to 7 in less than two months. That's what she said, eyyyy-

Obviously, somehow, having hair longer than nose level length, in a time when we can't get haircuts, is homosexual and undesirable in the eyes of God.

I will never understand how people like this exist.

I know this sounds like r/thathappened, trust me, I'm just as surprised as you are.

She had a short haircut so obviously she would say something like this.

Fellas, is it gay to not have hair cut short?"
4627,copypasta,Lit ad 😫,"So lit mobile just sent me this solar wireless battery pack - i'm exited - lets see whats inside. I really like this build: it's got hand grips on the side; it's shock-proof and water-resistant. The power bank has 20 thousand milliamp hours which can fully charge your phone up to 8 times. It's also got a convenient loop for carabiners.

On the back of the device we have a bunch of solar panels which can charge the battery bank in about 60 minutes. On the top of the device, there are 3 USB ports and 2 of them are fast chargers. If you hit the power button 2 times, the LED light comes on. If you hit the power button once, the LED lights will tell you how much battery you have. There's a micro USB port on the side for fast charging. My favourite part of this device is that it charges my phone wirelessly. There's a red light indicator at the top, to let you know that your phone is charging."
4628,copypasta,Not funny. Didn't Laugh,"Not funny I didn't laugh. Your joke is so bad I would have preferred the joke went over my head and you gave up re-telling me the joke. To be honest this is a horrid attempt at trying to get a laugh out of me. Not a chuckle, not a hehe, not even a subtle burst of air out of my esophagus. Science says before you laugh your brain preps your face muscles but I didn't even feel the slightest twitch. 0/10. This joke is so bad I cannot believe anyone legally allowed you to be creative at all. The amount of brain power you must have put into that joke has the potential to power every house on Earth. Get a personality and learn how to make jokes, read a book. I'm not saying this to be funny, I genuinely mean it on how this is just bottom barrel embarrassment at comedy. You've single handedly killed humor and every comedic act on the planet. I'm so disappointed that society has failed as a whole in being able to teach you how to be funny. Honestly, if I put in all my power and time to try and make your joke funny it would require Einstein himself to build a device to strap me into so I can be connected to the energy of a billion stars to do it, and even then all that joke would get from people is a subtle scuff. You're lucky I still have the slightest of empathy for you after telling that joke otherwise I would have committed every war crime in the book just to prevent you from attempting any humor ever again. We should put that joke in text books so future generations can be wary of becoming such an absolute comedic failure. I'm disappointed, hurt, and outright offended that my precious time has been wasted in my brain understanding that joke. In the time that took I was planning on helping kids who have been orphaned, but because of that you've wasted my time explaining the obscene integrity of your terrible attempt at comedy. Now those kids are suffering without meals and there's nobody to blame but you. I hope you're happy with what you have done and I truly hope you can move on and learn from this piss poor attempt"
4629,copypasta,I masturbated to my tutor’s voice.,"I don’t fucking know what I’m doing rn. This Quarantine is making me mad. So I go to university and study physics (I’m 19) and, due to the current events, every week they send us a PowerPoint presentation with voice. And today was the first time where there was a female voice... But since I’ve moved out and live alone rn and haven’t seen/met anyone for the duration of the quarantine I felt pretty lonely. The voice of the female tutor, who I’ve never seen in real life btw, made me feel sth idk... kinda loved and wanted in these times. So idk what has driven me to the decision to whip out my wiener and beat my meat to it. I was deadass looking at the PowerPoint screen and listening to her soft voice when I fucking busted a nut after a minute. I fucking came under the table and was crying afterwards bc I feel so lonely and am a sad piece of shit who does sth like that. And I don’t want to tell this story to my friends but have to share it with anyone... so there you go guys... have a great day.

4633,copypasta,"I thank you, kind stranger.","My entire life has changed after this award, I cannot thank you enough.

Before I got this, I was a NEET loser fapping to fictional 50000 year old dragon vampire demon girls on my 50 bucks IBM coom-puter, throwing all my allowance money and the cash I either found under the couch or sneaked off my parents to buy figurines and glass jars, or to donate to streamers, who then I send death threats to after they don't date me. 

I lived in my parent's attic AND basement, and I played games I pirated off shit websites with max volume so that I could drown the noise of my parents crying about how much of a loser I am, and constantly thinking about throwing me outside the house to finally pick up my life, leading to my parents having a shaky marriage as well as my ears developing tinnitus, let alone all the infections from never showering. 

But after I this, everything changed. A holy light shining from my coom-puter lit up my neighborhood like a million-volt lamp, a light so bright and holy my entire neighborhood went blind and then immediately regained vision due to the blessed power of your gift.

I felt power course through me, I have reached the spring of rebirth. I was no longer the shell of a person I once was.

With thundering footsteps that terrify gods, posture that even perfectly vertical light beams envy, and a body that Greek Gods would erase worlds to achieve, I emerged from my house, to the tears of joy my parents shed, I however do no care anymore, for they are many millenia behind me in evolution. I was the perfect life form. 

I ran across the nation for days, with many pathetic humans who are below my level by light-years falling in love with me. 

Then, I finally reached the highest cliff in a wild forest in the darkest hour. This is where I will have a new life, where I will return to nature, and dominate the food chain and the wild world itself. 

And as I looked across the rising crimson sun, I remembered the days I shed off, the days I suffered and was the lowest of the low, and I thanked you again, for blessing me with this chance.

Thank you, kind stranger."

4638,copypasta,Female bigfoot forced me to do it," This is where it happened back here in this dry creek bed. I was back here looking, I thought one of my dogs was back here and I was like “how did one of my dogs get out of the yard?” I saw a bunch of y’know movement and I got back and “well maybe it’s a deer” and I was worried about my dogs because there’s a lot of bigfoot and sasquatch in this area. I didn’t have a gun with me and so I got back here and that’s when I saw the female sasquatch. She tore out of the bush, knocked me down on the ground, and I thought she was gonna kill me, y’know? I’m like grabbing for a gun and then I realize “I didn’t bring a gun with me.” I didn’t have a dog with me, I was back here by myself; I was terrified. I was so terrified, it was so scary and I wouldn’t be back here right now except I feel the need to like get over my fear and what happened. And what happened was as soon as I was knocked down on the ground she starts ripping my clothes off me. She did! She starts pulling my pants off me and I’m like “oh great, she’s gonna kill me, they’re going to find my naked body here.” It’s worse, it’s worse. As soon as she got my pants off me, she started jerking the ween. And i’m like “y’know that’s not gonna work y’know what’re you doing?” And then the next thing I know, keep in mind this is a big sasquatch like comparable to a big hairy russian woman. I mean she was BIG, she was like y’know 7 ½ to 8 feet tall and hairy. And so, I’m down there on the ground, I’m completely naked, my clothes have been ripped off of me and she starts giving me a knobber. It was all just biological, I didn’t have any choice. And the next thing you know… y’know I blew my load. I blew my load into the sasquatch. As soon as I did that, she got up and she ripped down the- she let out this howl and ripped down this tree. And I thought “my god she’s gonna like take the tree and take me and take it and smash me,” right? No! It didn’t end, it didn’t end and then she starts blowing me again. SHE STARTS BLOWING ME AGAIN! And I’m like “y’know can you give me five minutes?” She didn’t even give me five minutes, she started blowing me again. The next thing you know, I bust a nut again. And then, she stands up and does one of these like “mmm” like “mmm, innit that good?” I swear to God, I swear to God. Then she hightails it into the woods this way. Now, I didn’t know what to do at this point, I’m like “what do I do? I’ve been raped by a bigfoot. Do I call the police? What do I do!?” I still don’t know what to do. I mean, she can be pregnant with my child. I’ll tell you one thing, I don’t go into the woods anymore unless I have a weapon with me. I’ll get over this, I think I should talk to somebody; maybe a counselor or something. I’ve never been raped before this, and listen, if it was a female human yeah let’s do it. But, this was like a creature like a monster. There’s a fuckin’ monster. I was raped on a creek bed. There’s poison ivy all over here, I’m gonna have poison ivy probably on my ween. Sucks! It sucks man! I felt like I couldn’t get fucking clean. I got home and started taking a bath and I just fucking feel like I can’t get fucking clean. It’s been a horrible experience and nobody will believe me. If I call the police they’ll tell me I’m fucking making it up. Fucking horrible! That’s the tree that she knocked down after the first time, after I busted my load into her. She’s probably pregnant with my fuckin’ hybrid baby. That’s my guess. This is the poison sumac, and this is all in that dried up creek bed and it’s everywhere. I’m sure I’m going to have poison sumac on my scroto, on the shaft. Don’t they eat poison sumac? So she was just eating the poison sumac before she gave me the knobber, she’d have that shit on her fuckin’ lips n shit. My ween’s gonna be breaking out and it isn’t gonna be with the Herp. Y’know what I’m saying? This sucks, I don’t know what to do. I’ll never go back down there alone without a dog or a gun. I don’t like being treated like a piece of meat like that, manhandled by some big hairy female. That was one of the worst- that was the worst. Seriously, that was the worst. I can’t even believe I blew my load. It was difficult, but I figured y’know she was making an effort I thought at some point I should too."

4648,copypasta,Bean Torpedo,"Benjamin ""Bleeding anal fissure"" Shapiro was created in a laboratory on January 15th 1984 in a failed attempt to create the worlds most realistic pocket vagina. Though he is indisputably a vagina, he does not fit inside the average pocket and is thusly considered a failure. Originally his creators had planned to incinerate him but once they realized he was quasi-sentient, they trained him to become a conservative political commentator. Ben Shapiro has written ten books including his 2004 New York Times best seller ""Diarhrea Spewing Prolapsed Donkey Butt: An Autobiography"" 

Despite being completely unlikable and wrong about mostly everything, he became the youngest syndicated columnist in the United States at the age of 17 and currently serves as the editor and chief of the Daily Wire, which he founded. He also hosts ""The Ben Shapiro Show"", a daily political podcast funded primarily by the femenine hygiene product industry.

Ben Shapiro identifies as Jewish but this has been disputed by GOD himself in a recent interview saying, ""I had nothing to do with that guy."" Despite being a quasi sentient vagina with no soul, Shapiro was able to make a deal with the devil for some violin talent."

4655,copypasta,It's unfair how the Pickle Rick episode is Criticized.,"It's unfair how the Pickle Rick episode is Criticized.

I enjoyed it. It has a lot of good stuff in it. Big things and little things. It's not my favorite, but it's better than most of Season 4 so far.

Rick talking to himself as a pickle, like oh boy, I'm stuck here, doopdy doo. And then the cat comes in and he starts talking to it and the primitive snake fear that cats have of cucumber-shaped objects. And his little monologue as he gets stuck in the sun, and then down the grate. They break the rule of ""show, don't tell"" so badly that it's actually funny. That ""get that parkour, get that parkour"" where he's talking to himself just loving the action of his rat body. I guess they really had to reach for ways to engage the audience's attention, but it works. Otherwise there would have been long periods of just little grunts and stuff.

I enjoyed the Iron Man-esque suit up scene with Rick. It's so elaborate; it should have literally taken *years* to set up something so complex and advanced, and yet apparently Rick did it behind the scenes in a matter of minutes. Using a cockroach brain controlled via tongue. Hilarious in its absurdity.

The action sequences, especially with Jaguar, plays into cliched action film tropes perfectly. It's a deconstruction of the genre.

The little bit where Rick puts the bottle in the recycling bin is great. Did they put that in as a way to prompt the exposition of the Solenya myth? I love asking myself how the writers may have arrived at some of the decisions they make.

And of course Susan Sarandon's exposition at the end where she flays Rick to the pickle bone is awesome. And the juxtaposition of her coprophagia counseling with her family counseling is hysterical. Bathos and pathos, hand in hand.

I'm a bit of a structure/story nerd, though, so I love to get deep into the nitty gritty of it.

Oh yeah, one of my favorite bits was in the outtakes, when Justin Roiland is trying to do the scene where the family talks to him in the garage and he has to tell Morty to turn him around so he can see. Justin is just dying with laughter and takes numerous takes to get it right."
4656,copypasta,The year is 20XX.,"The year is 20XX. Competitive Super Smash Bros Melee has reached its zenith. No longer are matches decided through complex inputs and tactics. It began when some questioned the idea of matchups against characters. The community realized that gameplay no longer mattered, and only the character. Tournaments became complex games of rock-paper-scissors, and eventually another epiphany was had. Why bother with deciding afterwards and wasting time when the match could be decided before it began? Thus, referees decided who won and who lost automatically using a combination of facial recognition AI, mandatory reflex tests, and standardized quizzes and tests on military tactics and stratagem. With time, tests weren't even needed. Judges became so acute at deciding who won and who lost that tournaments happened in seconds, and results uploaded in less. The final destination was reached. Babies were bred and engineered to become the most desirable ""players"", if one could call it that. Soon, humanity ceased to think, and became mindless slaves to the autonomous ones and zeroes that decided their worth, ironically becoming the machines they once played with."

4659,copypasta,A tale of Ram Ranch," It was high season at the Ram Ranch and everyone was hunting for cowboy butts, and there were no showers at the Ram Ranch. With a Canadian accent, he told me he looked up to the cowboy for fun, work and pleasure. It was ""cum season"" at Ram Ranch, Macdonald said, with the exception of his wife and two daughters.  But the saga was far from over when the sequel ""The Ram Ranch"" came out. The Legend of the Ram Rancher, ""a sequel to"" Ram Ranch, ""the original film.  Those who enjoy the risky side of the cowboys will be in love with ""The Legend of the Ram Rancher,"" the sequel to the original film. Just the kind of romance that comes with getting close to a cowboy and loving him. The Ram Ranch is undoubtedly on the right track, and what more could you want?  I always go back to the original ""The Legend of the Ram Rancher"" and its sequel because I want to enjoy this project.  Grant seems to scream at the top of his lungs as the music plays, distorting it so that he doesn't have to go through his Ram Ranch story. The song then disappears, only to return and grind the song a second time and then play it back again. I didn't seem aware that this was a deliberate effect of Grant until I mastered the mistake and made it a hit on playback.  This effect is also reflected in the sound effects of the video game ""Ram Ranch"" and in the music video for ""Ranch 2.""***\[*****4:00 PM*****\]***Now there are 36 naked cowboys pumping their huge throbbing cocks in the shower at Ram Ranch, and they are pumping them out. The video game ""Ram Ranch 2"" breeds 18 naked cowboy showers at Ram Ranch and has the highest number of naked cows in any game on PlayStation 2.  According to tradition, however, ""Ram Ranch 7"" takes a sharp left turn: The Ram Ranch is under siege, and 18 US Marines march in there to pull all the butts out of the cowboys ""bubble. Join the orgy and plunge deeper and deeper into the invasion until you are joined by 18 more naked cowboy showers and 36 naked cows.  As the group continues to travel through the rabbit hole of the Ram Ranch saga, they are thrown into a frenzy. They plan to interview Grant on their podcast, mainly to finally get his thoughts on the current state of affairs and his plans for the future. May the great resurrection of 2018 be a beacon of hope for all of us and send us all into another frenzy as we continue our journey through this rabbit hole into the Ram Ranch saga.  The popularity of Ram Ranch has not gone unnoticed since Grant MacDonald began releasing several more ""Ram Ranch"" videos in 2017. Member Tom has fallen in love with the story of Grant and his family and their journey through the rabbit hole of Ram Ranch.  Most videos stick to the sexual texts and are provided with a random number of unrelated versions. By February 2019, the videos had reached over 2.5 million and 1.2 million views, respectively.  Ram is the name of the second single from the album ""Ram Rancher,"" which was released on Apple Records in May 1971 by Ram Ram, a band from San Francisco, California.

why did anime became popular? cuz in an age of depression of consciousness and mass ideologies,the desire for honor and glory in shonen shows,the bright and beautiful world and enjoyable interactions in slice-of-life,or the representation of human suffering in evangelion or tokyo ghoul fill this deep need we have deep down,of something this world doesnt quite provide anymore. thats why theres so many ""right-wing"" weebs.

4666,copypasta,The state of florida has asked us to.....," I think I can shed some light on this subject. My name is Todd Hughes- my aunt Laura appeared in the video you're referring to, though against her will. It's been a difficult subject for my family, but I'd love to help clear up some misconceptions.  
In the late 80s, Miami's Sexual Predator unit began cracking down harder than ever on sexual misconduct. While sex offenders had long been forced to go door-to-door, a new policy was proposed: sending videotapes to Miami neighborhoods. This would give residents a convenient reference of local sex offenders' faces and voices. Over time, the idea morphed into a cruel mockery of the accused parties. In early videos, convicted sex offenders were forced into demeaning costumes and humiliating hats. Eventually, Officer Raymond H. Karr hatched the idea of writing degrading hip-hop raps for the accused to perform.  
Between 1986 and 1988, dozens of ""Sex Offender Shuffle"" videos were created. Sex offenders who had already served their sentence were forced to rap and dance, often at gunpoint. My aunt Laura was forced to participate, in order to be eligible for home ownership in North Bay Village. She was handed a crude rap implying that she ""touched her cousin"", though the actual circumstances were far more complicated. While a blood test proved that one of her volleyball students was a relative, their relationship was completely consensual. Regardless of the circumstances, NO ONE should be forced to rap against their will. Eventually, the ACLU stepped in. They helped SOS participant Marc Burmholdt sue Officer Karr, who promptly fled the country. In June 1988, Miami police chief Clarence Dickson was forced to resign, though it was presented as voluntary and unrelated to the SOS scandal.  
For years, our family thought they had buried this terrible chapter. But in 2009, the footage from my aunt's ""shuffle"" was posted to Youtube and presented as viral found footage, making a sad mockery of my aunt yet again. Thankfully, there was a silver lining. While organizing a (sadly-unsuccessful) class-action suit against Youtube, she reconnected one of the other SOS participants, Samuel Pound. Today they are married, and together they own and operate a sand store outside Los Angeles.  
I hope this was relatively interesting. I'm just tired of people believing the video was some kind of comedy spoof. I want the world to know the Laura Hughes-Pound I know- a warm, loving, tender, *incredibly* affectionate aunt."

FAQ

What does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

• ⁠Rudeness towards other Redditors, • ⁠Spreading incorrect information, • ⁠Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.

Am I banned from the Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise, I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is a privilege, not a right."

I would have to pee and instead of going to the washroom I would just drop my drawers and plant my ass on the hot vent and piss into it, and then air dry. I had no problem with this and didn’t see AT ALL why this was unordinary. I at one point casually told my friend and after that she wouldn’t leave me alone in rooms. Also once I was mad at my sister so I shat on her floor. I didn’t even know what to expect but my sister cried, my parents yelled at me, and I had to pick it up. I also would piss in her vent too"
4673,copypasta,My classmates and I had to apologise to some girl's dad because we used some curse words in the class' whatsapp group (students only btw). This is his response to our apology.

4675,copypasta,Turtle,"ATENTION ALL

This is a story of love, intrigue, and romance with a certain redditor and myself. The name was u/awkwardtheturtle and being a horny turtle raper was his game.... One late afternoon, during my regular walk from church back to my house I noticed a peculiar sound. A squishy, repetitive sound with lots of snorting, almost like animal sex. little did I realize how close of a guess that was...I pulled back the bushes covering the sound, and LO! There it was, a small boy named Ronald (who I would later get to know as u/awkwardtheturtle) was aggressively humping a dead, small turtle. Discusted by the combination of necrofilia and bstiality I took a step back, repulsed. But then a thought came to me...""this poor boy needs help! Companionship! A lover. And so I dragged the snot-nosed sobbing lad out of the turtle and into my car where I drove him to my house. We began making out (I out of pity, him with lust) the minute we got inside. The poor boy had never known what love was like with a human. I made the commitment to give him those exquisite feelings tonight. I forced him onto the bed, the poor mumbling, stuttering, snot nosed piece of shit! He could hardly talk he was so excited! We began making passionate love immediately, but something was wrong. He could not insert his penis in! I sat him down on the bed and through sobs he told me, ""my...my doctor says my penis is to small to ever have sex"" feeling terrible for the poor, wretched, snot nosed piece of shit, I sucked it for him. He kept mumbling something that I didn't understand until it hit me. He was repeatedly saying, ""Adolf, oh Adolf, yes, yes, YESSSS"" only then did I realize that u/awkwardtheturtle was a neo-nazi. I immediately stopped and kicked him out. I never saw from or heard from him again."
4676,copypasta,For when people complain about camera quality under videos (found on YouTube),"Picture yourself  being there and watching all you builded througout your life, your town, everyone you know,   swept away in less than 3 minutes, people desperately trying to save their loved ones, collect few items of sentimental value and run as fast as they can from the deadly disaster,  those who couldn't make it  into a safe place are clinging to their cars, debris or whatever object they could find so they can save their lives,  but thousands couldn't make it, and you couldn't save them either, you just stand there and watch/record them die.      And then along comes a contemptible-sociopathic-twat,  whining like a snotty-spoiled-brat, because the ""unskilled"", flabbergasted cameraman wasn't capable of recording  the disaster """"like a pro"""", like in Hollywood movies,  where the muscled-action-super-macho-hero, save the world from a disaster of apocalyptic proportions,  and then gets laid with the botox-face, siliconed-breasts, bleached-hair, trout-pout-lips, acrylic-nails,  thick-layers-of-make-up, sweetheart,  who was right beside him through it all, wearing the most revealing  and sexiest outfits ! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 🤣🤣  But, the mere fact that thousands of people died in this ghastly natural disaster of apocalyptic proportions, and survivors,  must cope with physical/psychological trauma for many years to come,  isn't the ""main frustration"" over here.  Apparently, what s really frustrating for you, sociopathic douchebags, is not being able to watch them die and lose it all, broadcasted on HDTV,  isn't it ? 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 But hey, sociopathic douchebags,  you still have a change to get your own disaster and a camera, record the whole thing and show the world how perfect you are in a gruesome life-threating situation,  what a highly-skilled cameraman you are when the elements unleash their murderous, unstoppable, uncontrollable ""rage"",  on puny little humans and their useless  constructions & accessories..."

Any contact with female is the dystopian road to babies guys.Be careful of the Subliminal man-woman messaging nd thank goodness for animal kingdom to annihilate the latter.


Andrew Jackson 2ne greatest president(behind Lincoln)? only one to return banks from shadowy organizations to American hands? Mortal kombat scorpions revenge released online: Truly extraordinary my Moonrakers of this achievement of men.


All comedy is sucked away by 51% of the world's population whose goal is replication of humans, not creativity, want to disintegrate dreams of the 49%. Need to be herded in correctional facilities to figure out how to deal with these actual walking viruses. Need to get torn up by animal kingdom. Movies with humans have the hero and girl trying to get with each other. They even include animals assuming human characteristics of that man-woman nonsense. Be careful of what gets brainwashed into your subconscious from this. Watch out for hole guys. The romance angle (romance(tm) is too much a term for this) is handled charmingly/cutesy but all of this is like aw man here we go with this stuff. I know this movie spiderman ffh is showing guidance to males how to deal with females. All imagination shown in this movie, creativity is the male ability, while females are replication of humans (aka babies) so both goals are contrasts with each other and know if you stick it in their hole your creativity goes swoosh disintegrates, you fall inline with patriarchy which is uncompromising. Replication is them celebrating the debauchery of humankind while creativity is trying to get closer to God (creating imaginative things.) Any contact with female is the road to babies guys. Even the cutesy way movie dalliances are portrayed. I cant provide all the know-how on the matter, what can I state here that someone else hasn't figured throughout the thousands of yrs of human knowledge. They want to grind up men but it is I who grind them into fine dust. Wear pink to take their power away? I get it's hormones, just j/o in toilet or napkin.

The cringiest app ever created? Now just you listen here you piece of lowlife scum. I hope you do get that you should be using reddit. ""Why?"" Your foolish brain may ask. Well, as a redditor, i can give you plenty of reasons. First off, the app is fucking cringe. You wanna be cringe? You really want to be cringe? The trash of society? A fucking normie? No. You don't. If you do, you're fucking sick. You're a disgusting human being that deserves to die. Hell, could I even call a normie like you human? Reason 2: Did you know Tik Tok is supported by the HONG KONG government? Bro. The HONG KONG government? Do you know what kind of fucked up shit they do? Me neither. I just saw a post on reddit saying they were bad. Reason 3: We will personally bully you to suicide. ""That's fucked up! "" You may think. No, it's not. You are cringe. You are a lowlife, a degenerate, a fucking scumbag. Me and my friends over at r/pewdiepiesubmissions and r/dankmemes will ensure you kill yourself. Reason 4: Pewdiepie said Tik Tok bad. Come on guys. Pewdiepie. Literally the KING OF YOUTUBE dislikes Tik Tok. Can you even argue with this one? No you can't. You use Tik
Tok. You're a retarded parasite that can't form a single fucking sentence, let alone give a proper argument. To conclude my talk, i will, ask you one last time to uninstall Tik Tok, and install reddit. ""And what if i don't? "" You may think. Well, I told you before, I will ENSURE of your suicide.

I put deodorant all around mine n up my butt crack where i shave.... in fact, so do most strippers n performers. Its not about keeping it fresh as much as its about PREVENTING RAZOR BUMPS. Its a very common thing to rub white deodorant into your skin around those areas to prevent ingrown hairs n bumps.  Never throws off my pH. I think it's sooooo gross many women will only ""wash"" their vag with plain water and zero soap bcuz they claim ""it will throw off my pH"" NO IT WON'T.  Unless you're shoving soap INSIDE yourself, your pH Will be FINE. The flaps n lips are just skin and it's perfectly fine to wash n scrub off that skin WITH SOAP (especially since it gets so sweaty n wet with discharge), and MUCH NEEDED.  Honestly, i can see why many men are disgusted by vagina nowadays. Women's hygiene is trash and the media teaching yall to not wash yourselves.  Talking about ""all you need is to rinse it off with water, a vagina naturally cleans itself"" 🙄🤢 NO.  The INSIDE of a vag cleans itself. The OUTSIDE of one though, DOESN'T CLEAN ITSELF ANYMORE THAN A BUTTCRACK ""CLEANS ITSELF"" scrub that shit!!! Yall are nasty frfr n i can tell you're all that way just by how you act like using hygiene products in that area is gross, when REALLY what's gross is that YOU DON'T.  The outer skin DOESN'T CLEAN ITSELF nor does it cause pH issues to clean it. Only the INSIDE is effected. Cleaning the lipz area with soap is FINE. 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️yall are all embarrassing"
4684,copypasta,Lit mobile ad,"So Lit Mobile just sent me this wireless battery pack, I'm excited, let's see what's inside. I really like the build, it's got hand grips on the side, it's shockproof and water-resistant. The power bank has 20,000 milliamps, which can fully charge your phone up to 8 times. It's also got a convenient loop for carabiners. On the back of the device, we have a bunch of solar panels which can charge the battery bank in about 60 minutes. On the top of the device, there are 3 USB ports and 2 of them are fast-chargers. If you hit the power button two times, the LED light comes on. If you hit the power button once, the LED lights will tell you how much battery you have. There's a micro-USB port on the side for fast charging. My favourite part of this device is that it charges my phone wirelessly. There's a red light indicator at the top to let you know that your phone is charging."
4685,copypasta,Gru is a god among men,"We all know Gru is the godly height of 14.5 feet tall and can move at a speed of 200 Meters per second. Based on average dick size, Gru’s penis is around 14 inches long. Also, Gru’s dick would weigh around 2 pounds considering the average weight of a dick is .77 lbs. If he swung his dick in a circular manner, it would have the centripetal acceleration of 72.57 meters per second. This means that gru can dickslap with the immense energy of 11,421 pounds per sq inch at a tip speed greater than 584415.58336974 MPH. In conclusion, Gru’s dickslap has enough energy to smash through 6” reinforced concrete and will cause a thunderclap as his dick breaks the sound barrier. I rest my case.
Jk, I further my case by pointing out The avg speed of ejaculate is 28 mph. This means that gru can ejaculate at a speed of roughly 70 MPH when standing still. If he decides to fling his ejaculate by swinging his dick in a circular fashion, it will travel at 584415.5*70= 40,909,085 mph. This means Gru’s ejaculate travels at a speed greater than 24 thousand times the speed of a bullet. Considering the average mass of ejaculate, 3.5 g, gru’s semen will impact the target with the energy of 1.715e9 Jouls, or roughly the amount of energy released in 667 pounds of TNT. In conclusion, if gru decided to weaponize his penis, he could easily conquer the world.
Now I rest my case"

4692,copypasta,Rant found on the Fortnite subreddit,"PSA: If you’re someone who shoots an unarmed player while they’re swimming over hatches in Team Rumble, I think you should know...

You're the reason your parents got divorced. And your parents are lying to you when they say “no, ttv_micropenis, you didn’t do anything wrong, we still love you”. 

The truth is your dad would rather be broke as fuck and live in a shitty apartment across town if it means he only has to spend half his waking hours during the week and every other weekend with you, because he hates your obnoxious little Flaming Cheeto-stained face and you are a fucking nightmare to be around. 

No seriously, I guarantee that at least one time in your life your parents sat across from each other at the kitchen table late at night after you’re in bed, your mother close to tears, the smell of booze hot on your dad’s breath. One of them jokes: “maybe we could just smother him in his sleep” and they share a good laugh. But then their eyes meet, and you can tell each one is wondering if the other is thinking the same thing, that yes, maybe they could just smother you in your sleep, and if they both kept their mouths shut they might just get away with it. 

But the moment passes, and no blood pact is made that night. He pours himself another drink. She’s been dry for over a year now, but she gets a glass from the cupboard and nods at him to pour one for her too. The look in his eye says “are you sure?” She nods. And together they drown their frustrations in cheap bourbon. And that’s the beginning of the end of their marriage, all thanks to you. 

Maybe some day you’ll grow up and develop a sense of self awareness. God, I hope so. The world has enough assholes already. 

Until then, keep padding your Team Rumble k/d stats and dancing take the L, kid. Dance like no one’s watching. Because seriously, NO ONE’S watching your fucking shitty twitch channel."
4693,copypasta,Sexism in Chex Quest HD,"Chex Quest's sexism wasn't really a thing for me back when it was only the Chex Warrior aka Fred against a horde of weird looking flemoids, but now they added diversity with Wheatney (a female), NACL96 (black), PRETZL (transhumanist) and Shane (an obvious reference to Trump supporters from the southern USA) and now it has become quite obvious.  


Normally, such diversity would be a good thing (except for Shane who just exists to pender to conservative audiences). But when playing as Wheatney I just felt like I'm playing some disgusting perverts fantasy. You play as a young female who has to defend herself from monsters with phallic shaped hoses for mouths that shoot sticky goo at you and follow you. It just felt wrong and I had to stop my Wheatney playthrough because I was so shocked by this realisation.  


It is also shown ingame that Wheatney is more of a coward than the other (male) characters. When she jumps down the hole in the very first level she screams, enforcing the weak female stereotype. The other characters only have ""manly"" oneliners at this part. Has the world not learned a thing from Anita Sarkeesian?  


My suggestion to help decrease the probability of a future scandal involving this game is to immediately fix the sexist Wheatney voice lines and to alter the flemoid design to something less offensive."

4695,copypasta,Credits to u/motupatlu34 for the original post,"I was on the r/garfsexual subreddit the other day, hoping id get some high quality garf hentai, and you know what I saw? You know what someone there had the audacity to post on https colon slash slash w w w DOT reddit DOT com SLASH r SLASH garfsexual? An nsfw drawing of garfield as ... a WOMAN. Garfield is not canonically a woman. He is a male. What's worse is that it wasn't even futanari, which could be rationalized somehow. No. They didn't even include girldick, that was garfield w/ (excuse the pun) a pussy. I cannot believe this. Garfield is a male. I expect sexualized depictions of garfield online to be of him with a big throbbing barbed cat cock, but these fucking redditors keep drawing female garfield. It makes me sick. There are female characters in the Garfield comics, so why not just do this with Nermal? They don't have to ruin the good name of Garfield like this. My day, no, my life is ruined because these supposed ""garfsexuals"" aren't even into the REAL garfield, just this simulacrum of garfield as a woman with massive supple breasts and a feminine figure. It disgusts me. It is truly revolting. It is the antithesis of the true garf, and I will not stand for it."
4696,copypasta,TFS obliterates Father Shaun,"[8:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5aJFZ3rGr8&t=488s) 

The man, simply known as Father, took a breath as he heard his own father's voice beyond the door. He'd been waiting for this moment. Waiting for what felt like ages.  

He was well aware that his...dad (and it was truly odd to think of his biological parents after so much therapy) was merely intended as a back-up subject by the original Institute scientists who had raised him, and may have never been unfrozen had circumstances not been what they were. And yet, here he was, talking to the Synth built in the likeness of Father, Shaun, himself, when he was a child, young and still not quite aware of the realities of the world. Perhaps it was a bit cruel to present his father with a false version of his own child right before revealing that his true son had grown into an old man without him, but the scientist in him wanted to see his reactions, and perhaps gain a measure of what kind of man his father was. And a weird, somewhat twisted, part of him kinda wanted to see if his father would punch the filthy synth in the face. 

Father grimaced, shaking his head to rid himself of the random thought. His irrational hatred of synths had taken quite a while to grow out of, and he certainly didn't want to relapse now, so instead, he focused his thoughts on his father.  Currently...well, to be quite frank, Father wasn't quite sure what to make of the odd shirtless man wearing a loincloth (Grognak the Barbarian's?) and a navy captain's hat (well, his father was a captain...in...huh. He didn't actually know what branch of the military his father was a part of...). 

He'd been planning to speak up the second he saw his father entering the institute, but...well, it was one thing to hear that his father was a bit...odd, quite another to actually see it in person. Yet he stuck to the script, after a brief pause, and now, they were finally about to meet. After all these years, he would finally meet his only remaining biological parent.  

Father suddenly frowned, an odd little tic he'd developed whenever his thoughts drifted to his biological parents. Specifically, his mother. He wasn't sure why, but every time he thought of his biological mother, he felt the strangest mixture of horror and disgust. When he was younger, he'd even burst out crying. The scientists thought it might've been some residual attachment, perhaps an early link that had never been quite disrupted. They were quite confused when he'd gotten violently ill when they tried talking more about his mother. Father shuddered in revulsion. Even now, he wasn't quite why, but that didn't particularly matter now. His mother was long dead.  

Father sighed, the same strange feeling of relief spreading through him each time he recalled the...er...tra....tragi.......death of his mother, though he then frowned again as he heard the synth his father was talking to begin to get erratic. Shame, he'd hoped they would hit it off better. Nevertheless, it was now time to finally meet his own father. Face to face.  

Standing up straight, trying to present the perfect image of the confident leader of the most technologically advanced faction in the Commonwealth, Father opened the door and stepped through. Upon doing so, he immediately heard his father shout ""YOU MONSTER!"" And then he promptly felt three pieces of rebar and a solid block of cement slam straight into his chest, crushing his ribcage into his internal organs in an instant. It took about three seconds for him to crumple to the floor, dead in an instant. 

Probably for the best, considering his father then proceeded to strip him to his underwear and attempted to mutilate his body.

(...I have no idea why I wrote this. That moment just inspired me. I blame the Captain.)"

Fuck egar his ass can go in the drain"
4698,copypasta,America's Got Talent,"Now I'm wishing America's Got Talent would take inspiration from this show. Imagine it: they introduce some woman whose daughter Jennie had passed away to cancer. Jennie's dream had always been to be a world famous performer, so mom hopes the dreams of her daughter live on through her stage acts. She tells the judges about the cancer battle; the crowd ""ooh""s and ""Aww""s at just the right parts, and then the music gets serious. Howie asks ""what was your daughter's performance art?""

And the woman says ""ramming strange objects up the asshole.""

Crowd claps politely. Howie raises his eyebrows. ""Let's see it!"" he challenges, as a hush settles over the room.

A table is wheeled out. On it is a length of rope, two shampoo bottles, a burning candle, and a bowl with small pieces of paper in it.

The woman puts one finger up, as though to say ""wait!"" to the crowd... They all silence in anticipation. The woman places one end of the rope within her ass. It slowly begins to crawl in deeper and deeper still, pulled along by the woman's skillful contractions of the sphincter. The rope picks up speed, zooming upwards now with the impression of a greedily-slurped piece of spaghetti. The coils on the table are shooting apart with greater and greater frantic twists and whirls, threatening to knock objects off the table. With a *schlop* the free end of the 400 ft rope launches free through the air and up the woman's ass. The crowd claps politely, but this is nothing they haven't seen before.

She moves next to the candle. She slides it up her ass, flame end first, with little flourish. She curtseys, expectantly, but the crowd's dull applause shows that enthusiasm is slipping. She then takes the shampoo bottles and pops them in, one at a time. The crowd yawns. But the woman's act has only begun.

She walks for the bowl and draws a name from it. ""Simon Cowell,"" she announces. He walks to the stage.

She instructs him to lie down. He does. She then twerks above his head. Silence hangs heavy upon the stage. And then, the magic happens: shampoo begins to squirt out into Simon's hair with each downward thrust. The crowd goes wild.

She continues thrusting. The candle pops out, still lit, and lands in Simon's lap. The crowd screams and is now drooling mad with energy and power. She holds up a finger, as though saying ""wait there's more"". She then twerks out the rope, but it's no longer just a rope... Out pops a noose, the rope having been fully prepared and tied by her lower gut while she twerked. The crowd begins to cheer and convulse and foam as Simon hangs himself on stage. But the magic is not yet over.

She draws one more name from the bowl. ""Howie Mandell,"" she calls. He walks up on stage and watches Simon's body swing on its creaking noose, clumps of shampoo sitting on his head like a lumpy melted angelic halo.

""Very impressive so far... What are you putting up there next?""

""You,"" she says, as she begins to climb a ladder. The crowd is entering adrenal failure from all the screaming and fervor. Most hands are bloodied, tattered ruins from the thundrous nonstop applause. And then, all at once, silence falls. The woman is atop the ladder over Howie. She leaps and falls ass first onto his head. And with a pop, she takes him in.

The crowd explodes into applause and screaming. 1/4 are now dead, and more will soon join them. The woman asks Howie ""what do you think?""

And from within, as though controlling a puppet, the woman's own hand slowly raises and shows a thumbs up gesture.

From within the woman's head, a second, smaller voice speaks: ^""you're ^going ^to ^Vegas, ^baby."""
4699,copypasta,Aggressively fart or shit as loudly as you can.,"Aggressively fart or shit as loudly as you can. I once had to shit in the Walmart bathroom. I walked in and this family walked right in behind me. They were talking really loudly. So I went into a stall to float a log and literally the moment my cheeks hit the seat, some prick started knocking. I was like ""I just sat down"". And he knocked again. I go ""use the other stall"". A moment passes and this fucker knocks again. So I've had enough. I released hell in the form of the loudest, sloppiest spatter house of an ass blasting shit I could've mustered accompanied by growling and the works. They must'Ve got the point because that entire family scattered out of the bathroom as quickly as they could. It's one of my proudest moments."

4862,soccer,"The best free-kick taker you've never heard of, a clinical carpenter and an answer to Mertesacker: the most fascinating players in the Faroese top flight","The past two weeks have seen /r/soccer go mad over the resumption of the Bundesliga, with each goal making the front page and incredibly original jokes like ""Håland hadn't scored in two months"" confirming this subreddit's reputation as the home of comedy. To be honest, though, I'm not sure exactly why people are so excited about some small beer drinkers league - especially when the real high-level competition, the Betri Deildin, began in the Faroe Islands a full week earlier.

The league has everything that all passionate football aficionados have been missing. Crests with [Vikings](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/V%C3%ADkingur_G%C3%B8ta_logo.svg/1024px-V%C3%ADkingur_G%C3%B8ta_logo.svg.png) and [hammers](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ef/Havnar_B%C3%B3ltfelag_logo.svg/1024px-Havnar_B%C3%B3ltfelag_logo.svg.png)? Check. [Incredible scenery](https://twitter.com/BallTekkers/status/1235144783963844608)? Check. [Fantasy football](https://fantasy.tv2.no/)? Check. Goal celebrations with no social distancing? Check. (Thanks to early and frequent testing, the Faroes have essentially eradicated coronavirus.)

To introduce /r/soccer's local club supporters, comedic geniuses, and 4K Despacito highlight makers to this incredible competition, here are some of the most interesting players plying their trade in the middle of the North Atlantic.

(I'm not Faroese - most of the information in this post is compiled from various Google-translated Norwegian sites, so if I missed out on any players feel free to point them out in the comments!)

**Adrian Justinussen (Forward, HB, 21 y/o)**

Possibly the best Faroese player in the league at the moment, and definitely the most in-form. This season, he's scored six goals in three matches - yesterday, he plundered four goals and an assist in the first half against AB Argir in a 5-0 win, including a [hattrick of free kicks](https://streamable.com/elziu1). His contributions could be key to HB's title push this season after they finished fourth last year, a disappointment for the islands' most decorated football club.

Despite his incredible dead ball ability, consistency (16 and 20 goals from 26 matches, respectively, in the last two campaigns) and obvious potential, Justinussen is yet to play for the senior Faroese national team - and for a fairly unusual reason. After a flight to Romania with the U19 national side, he developed a fear of flying, making it impossible to travel to away matches outside the country. However, in an interview with Norway's TV 2 three weeks ago, he revealed he had been working with a psychologist and hoped to move abroad next season. In recent weeks, Justinussen has been heavily linked with Icelandic giants Valur, whose manager Heimir Guðjónsson was in charge of HB from 2017 to 2019.

**Klæmint Olsen (Forward, NSÍ, 29)**

While some insightful individuals might consider Ligue 1 a ""farmers' league,"" it would be far more apt to call the Betri Deildin a ""carpenter's league"" given the profession of one of its best players.  Despite working part-time as a carpenter, Klæmint Olsen is the league's all-time top goalscorer with an enviable record of 188 goals from 297 appearances. The Faroes' answer to Alan Shearer even has an inspirational story to go with his impressive feats: he was born with a misalignment in his left foot, making him have to shift all his weight to his right leg when running. Olsen has received offers to play professionally from clubs in Iceland, Denmark, Poland and even Asia, but he prefers to continue working part time - a shame because he's shown the ability to play at a higher level, scoring a [hattrick against Hibernian in Europa League qualifying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_d0WEC5AHg) and embarrassing one of the best defences in the world with an [improvised goal from a corner against Spain](https://vimeo.com/341311213) last year. With a new Swedish coach and Olsen's continued dominance in the league (26 goals from 27 appearances last season), NSÍ could be unlikely title contenders this year.

**Sonni Nattestad (CB, B36, 25)**

Per Mertesacker might be the most famous giant to play in the European top divisions, but the Faroes boast their own two-meter ""BFG"" in Sonni Nattestad. The 25-year-old - born in Haiti - is well-traveled, having played for the likes of Midtjylland and AC Horsens in Denmark, Molde and Aalesund in Norway, and FH and Fylkir in Iceland, but returned to his homeland to play for B36 at the start of the year. Nattestad's obvious heading ability has brought him two goals in 25 national team appearances, against Latvia and Liechtenstein, but he hasn't been called up since the end of 2018. Once the coronavirus crisis is over, and with good performances for one of the most consistent teams in the Betri Deildin, it wouldn't be a surprise to see him called up in the future.

Thanks for reading! Let me know if you liked this short writeup, and I'd be happy to do the same for other leagues that are restarting in the future."

4869,soccer,Preview: Dortmund vs Bayern (Westfalenstadion),"The Bundesliga is back and for the last two weeks has captivated the world of football. However, a couple of my friends have told me, that they’re just not that into it. I have therefore taken it upon myself to write a bit of a preview to set the stage and bring a bit of context to the big game tonight for those of you who have the same feeling my friends had and to try to give a preview of what, in my opinion, is one of the most important games left to be played this season in European football.

With 7 games still to play, Bayern are firmly in the driver seat commanding an impressive 4-point lead over second place Dortmund. The stage is set, tonight 18:30 at the Westfalenstadion one team will take a monstrous step forward in the title race, resulting either in another unfortunate fore gone conclusion or the opportunity to produce an exciting finish to the Bundesliga season.

Both teams are coming into the game off the back of convincing victories, both seemingly unfazed or even emboldened by the eerie Geistspiel atmosphere. Union fought admirably in Buli 26 and will rightful ponder what could have been, if they had had a full Alten Försterei behind them. Dortmund on the other hand have started the second Rückrunde as if there had been no break at all. They seemed completely at ease as they ruthlessly dispatched of Schalke in the Revierderby 4-0 in Buli 26. Wolfsburg put up more of a fight in Buli 27, it would have been extraordinary to be honest if they hadn’t, but nethertheless Dortmund were overwhelming and showed some absolutely top-drawer counter attacking football.

The lack of fan presence will surely benefit Bayern in this fixture but to what extent is not yet completely clear. It’s hard to predict exactly how big of an impact the Geistspiele atmosphere will have on the benefit of home advantage. It is however the new norm and we will have plenty of time to find out.

**Expected line ups and formations**

Dortmund named an unchanged line up in the last two games, however that is likely to change due to the possible addition of Sancho to the starting line up or the possible omission of Hummels due to the nick he picked up on Saturday. Losing Hummels for this game would be utterly devastating and it couldn’t have come at a worse time for Dortmund. If he can’t play Can will take his place and surely give his everything for the cause but against a team like Bayern you absolutely need to have your best team on the pitch.

There has been much speculation due to the recent absence of Sancho from the Dortmund starting lineup especially as he was fit enough to play a combined 36 minutes of the two games post Corona. Dortmund fans will be praying this is just Favre taking extra care with Sanchos reintroduction to the team, one eye firmly locked on tonight’s clash rather than a sign that Sancho’s time at Dortmund could be coming to an end. His tidy assist to kill off Wolfsburg on Saturday will have made his return to the first 11 against Bayern all the more likely. In that case Favre will have a difficult decision ahead deciding who to drop for Sancho. Both Brandt and Hazard have been in top form and I expect he will be reluctant to drop either of them. For this reason, I expect Brandt to be pulled back deeper into Midfield and for Dahoud to make way. I expect Dortmund to line up in a 3-4-3 from left to right as follows:

**Bürki, Akanji, Hummels/Can, Piszczek, Gurreiro, Brandt, Delaney, Hakimi, Hazard, Haaland, Sancho.** *Injuries: Reus (Foot), Zagadou (Knee), Witsel (Muscle), Hummels (Possible injury)*

To come out of this game on top, Dortmund will have to be at their very best and play to their strengths. Overcrowding the midfield and pressing Bayern hard before launching a blistering counter attack into the wide areas to make use of their wing backs, who are in scintillating form, will be the recipe for success. Hakimi and Guerriero have a combined haul of 12 goals and 12 assists for Dortmund in the Bundesliga this season and have been game changing since the restart. Adding to that Hazard, who has had a similarly successful return, Sancho (whos record speaks for itself) and Haaland, you can almost guarantee that Dortmund will be able to punish any mistakes afforded to them.

Bayern have restarted in a similarly commanding fashion. Dispatching of their previous two opponents with relative ease despite the apparent lack of interest in defending set pieces. Hairy moments are fleeting and they know it. Bayern are a cut above the rest of the competition, and this is made consistently apparent as they have notched up 12 wins in their last 13 Bundesliga games, a 0-0 draw with Leipzip the only blemish on a spectacular record. This has propelled them firmly into the driving seat for the Bundesliga title.

The simple fact of the matter is, if Bayern are allowed to play their game they will win. Decent defensively but with an absurd amount of talent in midfield and the front man has been the face of the Bundesliga for many years now. I expect Bayern to line up similarly as vs Frankfurt. That being a 4-2-3-1 with Goretzka and Kimmich holding (yesterday Hansi Flick confirmed Thiago didn't travel with the squad), Coman on the right, Gnarby coming in for Perisic on the left and of course Müller playing the number 10 role and Lewandowski up top, looking to add to his ridiculous 27 goal haul. Speaking of stats, Thomas Müller has, in typical Müller fashion, quietly amassed a hefty 17 assists. Considering he started the season out of favour with former coach Niko Kovac, this tally seems even more impressive. With 7 games still to play, including the game tonight, he has a real chance of breaking Kevin De Bruynes famous 21 assist record season at Wolfsburg in 2013/2014. The full expected line up 4-2-3-1 left to right as follows:

**Neuer, Davies, Alaba, Boateng, Pavard, Goretzka, Kimmich, Gnarby, Müller, Coman, Lewandowski**. *Injuries: Coutinho (Ankle), Tolisso (Ankle), Sule (Knee), Thiago (Adductor).*

If Bayern fall into their rhythm and are consistently able to work the ball around Dortmunds midfield, it seems almost inevitable that they will sooner or later break the Dortmund resistance. Pavard has found a knack for sneaking himself into quite dangerous positions undetected, I could envisage him getting on the end of some early crosses into the box from deep, which I’ve noticed are particularly hard to deal while playing the 3 at the back formations. I attribute this to the lack of big traditional “Edd it” centre backs possessing the pace and technicality to play in a drei Kette.

The game has been naturally billed as Lewa vs Haaland. A clash of titans that has provided a much needed resurgence of excitement around der Klassiker (I’m sorry). In my view however the game will be won in the individual duels in midfield. How well will Dortmund be able to disrupt Bayerns flow? How successful will their press be? Will Bayern respect the pace and ability of Dortmunds wide men and their uncanny consistency of getting the ball into the box exactly to where Haaland needs it and of course, failing that just finishing the chance off themselves? Will the pace of Davies completely cancel Hakimi? Will Dortmund be able to fire themselves up for revenge after the embarrassing 4-0 defeat in November which saw their golden boy Sancho hauled off after 30 minutes for his part in the tragic performance?

Will Dortmund show the world that they aren’t to be counted out just yet, oder wird es wieder Müllern?

In any case, if you haven’t yet been able to hype yourself up for the Bundesliga, there’s never been a better chance. The general consensus is that the fixture run to the finish favours Dortmund giving this game and even further air of importance and possibility. How do you guys think the game will go?"

On 23 May 2020, just two days ago at the time I'm writing this, Bayern Munich defeated Eintracht Frankfurt 5-2 to go 4 points a top of the Bundesliga, ahead of second-place Borussia Dortmund. In said game, left-back Alphonso Davies got both an assist to Thomas Müller in the 41st minute to put Bayern up 2-0, and scored one himself to make the scoreline 4-2, twenty minutes later. Alphonso is Canadian, born in a Ghanaian refugee camp, but raised in Edmonton, Alberta. About 7 months earlier, on 26 October 2019, Chelsea had a Premier League match against Burnley away at Turf Moor. Chelsea won the match 4-2, but, if anything, the match is remembered for Christian Pulisic's perfect hat-trick in that game, Not only did that make Pulisic the youngest Chelsea player to score a hat-trick for the club, as well as the first to do it since Didier Drogba in 2010, but it also made him the second American to score a hat-trick in the PL, the first being Clint Dempsey's 3 goals against Newcastle in 2012 to seal a 5-2 victory for the Cottagers.

If you hopped in a time machine and told an avid football fan from 1985 that a Canuck would be a regular feature for one of the best clubs in the world, and a man that would score 5 goals in 3 games shares the same hometown as The Hershey Company itself, you'd currently be residing in Demented Hills. After all, in 1985, Canada and the United States held Elo Ratings of 36 and 60 respectively - there's no way so much could change.

While, as demonstrated earlier, things have gotten much better for both countries footballing-wise, the immediate years following 1985 were horrific for the United States Soccer Federation and the Canadian Soccer Association, however, they were extremely interesting, so I'm gonna talk about them.

&#x200B;

***So why was 1985 such an influential year for the USSF and CSA?***

Do you remember/know about when Pelé, Beckenbauer, and Chinaglia played for the New York Cosmos? When George Best played for the Los Angeles Aztecs, Fort Lauderdale Strikers, and San Jose Earthquakes? How about when Johan Cruijff played for the Aztecs and Washington Diplomats?

All these players played in the North American Soccer League, or the NASL. The NASL, founded in 1968, featured a plethora of teams throughout the US & Canada, and while it was primarily loaded with foreign players, it also gave opportunity for some American talent to arise. Such players include Rudy Glenn, Kyle Rote Jr., Rick Davis, and future Super Bowl winner Chris Bahr. Unfortunately, in 1985, the league folded after deteriorating from 24 to 9 teams, losing teams with great names such as ""Calgary Boomers.""

While the NASL did give a tunnel for Americans like the ones already mentioned to play high-level domestic football, generally, it did a pretty bad job of developing American players. For example, the 1990 World Cup roster featured 0 former NASL players; not one. This wasn't helped either by the fact that, at the time, the USMNT barely ever played games, playing maybe a couple times a year. Canadian players were developed slightly better, the 1982 team, for instance, was a game shy of reaching the World Cup, and only had NASL players to boast.

Either way, the importance placed on big name foreign players and other foreign players who either couldn't quite cut it in their national league, or wanted a bigger paycheck, combined with the lack of a salary cap, put American & Canadian soccer in a very tough spot, one with a huge void, one that we'd see try to be filled several times.

Since the only outdoor soccer teams left were U.S. Open Cup teams in regional teams with long-lasting history, but haven't made much progress due to the lack of promotion and relegation in the US (I'm talking Greek-American, Milwaukee Bavarians, Maccabi Los Angeles, other teams with ethnic names, etc.), the first nationwide league to sweep up the best American talent was one that already existed; the MISL.

MISL was just a little bit different than your average football league though. While most football leagues encourage tactical play, physicality, technicality, all that good stuff, the MISL was like if you took the NASL and put it in an arcade machine. Minifootball, it's called around the world, alters *o jogo bonito* in several significant ways. Smaller pitch with turf, smaller goals, less players, walls; it's somewhat of a cross between futsal, five-a-side, and ice hockey. While there were certainly more Americans and Canadians in this, Joey Fink, Bruce Savage, Juli Veee (amazing name), and many more. However, that doesn't mean they were... good. It also didn't mean that the league was stable either, the only two teams played throughout the entire competition, attendance rarely reached 9,000, and their best ever player was a Yugoslavian who wanted to play in NASL but was banned from FIFA competitions because he defected from his native country. Very cool, FIFA.

Inevitably, the lack of financial stability from the get-go, as well as not being a FIFA-sanctioned league, on top of not really being the same sport as actual association football, were all just too much for the MISL too handle. It folded in 1992, with 7 teams left, halving the 14 teams in the league at it's peak. If anything, the best thing to come out of the MISL was that it inspired the creation of Arena Football, an equally financially unstable version of American football, prioritizing fast pace, big hits, and *touchdowns, baby.*

***Canadian Soccer League (CSL); b. 1987, d. 1992***

We now head to our northern brethren to view the short-lived Canadian Soccer League, the first professional football league predominantly in Canada since the days of Toronto City in the Eastern Canada Professional Soccer League of the 1960's, featuring legends of the game like the late Sir Stanley Matthews. The main separator between the CSL and other Canadian leagues of the past such as the old 4 major leagues (The Pacific Coast League, The National League of Ontario/Quebec, the aforementioned ECPSL, and the Western Canada League), is that the CSL was *nation-wide*, something the countries hadn't really seen before. This was done as an effort to bring popularity to the sport in Canada, as the 1986 team didn't feature any players playing in Canada - because there were no professional Canadian teams to play for. After the NASL, they just... didn't exist, or were on hiatus. The CSL wanted to change that.

This new CSL league was very brief though, with a rather interesting league structure. Due to travel concerns, instead of playing round robin home-and-away like many leagues, the CSL went round robin for the teams in your division, and one game for those in the opposing division, resulting in 20 games from 8 teams. The top 3 teams per division would make the playoffs, with the 1st seed getting a bye into the semifinal Although the league never really caught on with the Canadian public, it did show some promising signs. The Vancouver Whitecaps were in this league, as well as in the NASL and the next league I'm going to talk about, and still exist today. Justin Fashanu, the first openly gay footballer, was second leading goalscorer in 1989. However, despite those small flashes, the CSL inevitably folded in 1992, leaving the domestic league void wide open in Canada.

***A-League, born American Professional Soccer League (APSL); b. 1990, d. 1996, rs. 1996, d. 2004***

*I'll just preface this by saying that this section will only go over the APSL, as the A-League was never a first-division league, since the MLS had been founded by 1996, successfully ending the ""awkward phase.""*

Soccer in the US & Canada was in a really strange place in 1989. The champions were taken by taking the champions of the two major regional leagues; this year being the east-coast Fort Lauderdale Strikers of the American Soccer League defeating the Western Soccer League's San Diego Nomads. A year later, in 1990, the ASL and WSL merged to create a super league of sorts; the American Professional Soccer League. Just like when the NFL had it's merger in 1970, the two leagues that formed the APSL were transformed into conferences; the American Conference and the Western Conference. The league started out bright-eyed and bushy-tailed with 22 teams, but, like every other league mentioned here, the lack of attendance numbers combined with exposure issues and travel costs and player salaries - it seemed doomed from the start, in retrospect. There were 32 teams total to ever play in the APSL, but most of them only played one or two years with a sassy name like Los Angeles Salsa and New York Centaurs... Centaurs? Really? Anyway, most of the lasting teams were old NASL clubs (like the Washington Diplomats), most of which still exist today as phoenix clubs in the MLS and USL (the CSL's Whitecaps, the Tampa Bay Rowdies, Seattle Sounders, Impact de Montreal, etc.) The league wasn't all bad, then. A lot of clubs that are central to the core of American and Canadian soccer likely wouldn't have still existed without the APSL; it walked so MLS could run.

***Conclusion***

Soccer in the US & Canada was weird. It was exciting, and it added flavor to the adventurous sports diet. Although all these leagues seemed to fail miserably, they did *just* enough to keep the sport alive, and now, neither country qualified for the World Cup, so what's the point of anything anymore. Goodbye.
