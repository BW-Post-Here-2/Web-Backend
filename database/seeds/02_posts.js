        "Woman, 65, needs to cut costs and simplify finances. This plan will give her $157,000 a year",
      post_text:
        "A woman we’ll call Nancy, 65, lives in Ontario. An officer of a financial institution, she has recently been generating after-tax income of $15,700 per month. Unfortunately, her future is clouded by the chance that a serious heart condition could worsen. Investment returns are less important than life expectancy, so it is imperative that she cut costs and live with less stress. With that in mind, we have designed a financial plan that generates ample cash. It diversifies her assets, reduces investment risk, allows Nancy to enjoy what she has earned and is structured to leave assets to beneficiaries such as her three grown children or charities. How this single woman with a modest income can make her travel dreams come true in retirement Couple’s fear of stocks and bonds and aversion to financial planners is putting them on the path to poverty For couple with net worth of $3.4 million, comfortable retirement is a matter of when, not if Nancy’s real estate holdings, which consist of her $2,575,000 home, a $1,200,000 investment property and a $675,000 cottage, make up 85 per cent of her assets. She also has $698,000 in financial assets and $90,000 worth of personal property. The investment property and financial assets both produce income that adds substantially to her employment income. Nancy has $590,000 of mortgages, $365,000 of which is on her investment property. The balance, $225,000, is on her own home. Interest on the investment property mortgage is tax-deductible; interest on the home mortgage is not deductible. She needs a plan to simplify her life, for financial assets are easier to manage than buildings that need maintenance. Family Finance asked Graeme Egan, a financial planner and portfolio manager who heads CastleBay Wealth Management Inc. in Vancouver, to work with Nancy. “What’s wanted here is advice on her plan to sell her present house in order to free up capital to generate income. It would trigger no capital gains tax. She could move into her investment property, though it would require $350,000 of renovations. Nancy also has a lake cottage worth $675,000. She’d like it to keep for her children. Valuing property Dividing assets after she passes away would be easier with less real estate to distribute among heirs. If she did sell her house, she could net $2,446,250 after five per cent selling costs. Take off two mortgages, a total of $590,000, and deduct $350,000 needed to spruce up the rental for her own use and she would be left with about $1.5 million. The rental property has two units. She could live in one and rent one to a son, Egan notes. By moving into one of the two units, Nancy would trigger the Canada Revenue Agency’s Change of Use Rule. The property would be deemed to have changed its character and there would be capital gains tax to be paid on its appreciation. However, Nancy could file an election to defer the tax until the property is sold. The election has to be filed in the year the change of use is made. She would have to pay capital gains tax on the investment property’s change in value from the time she purchased it to the time it became her principal residence. The election could be filed on just the one unit given that the other unit would continue to be a revenue-producing rental. The monthly budget Nancy has focused on real estate investment and has no Tax-Free Savings Account. Although $7,954 of her $15,700 monthly take home income goes to mortgages, tax and property maintenance, she has $7,746 of income for other things. She has an expensive car lease, $868 per month, that will end in about a year. She contributes $2,125 to her RRSP each month. That will eventually end. With available cash or proceeds of sale of her house, she should open a TFSA and fill her $63,500 space. If she reduces her hefty property allocation and raises her allocation to financial assets, she could settle on a portfolio half property and half financial assets. Those financial assets could be half bonds, half stocks, Egan suggests. She has $50,000 cash that we’ll leave for care should she need it. Retirement plans For the sake of simplicity, we assume that Nancy retires this year. If she sells her home, applies $350,000 to renovating the rental where she could live, pays the mortgage off, then she will have $1.87 million with no tax on the capital gain of her principal residence. If she elects to structure annual payments of this money, growing at three per cent per year after inflation for 25 years, she could have $8,690 per month or $104,300 per year. She will have $63,500 in her TFSA. With the three per cent assumption for returns after inflation, it will produce $3,650 per year or $305 monthly in 2019 dollars per year for 25 years to her age 90. There is $648,000 in her RRSP. That sum, still growing at three per cent per year after inflation, will yield $36,130 per year or $3,010 monthly for 25 years to her age 90. Her monthly pre-tax cash flow at age 65 with these assumptions will total about $12,000. Add her expected Canada Pension Plan benefits, $1,133 per month, exclude TFSA payouts, and she will have $157,600 annual taxable income. She will lose all of her annual $7,289  Old Age Security to the clawback which, at time of writing, starts when taxable income exceeds $75,910 and ends when income hits $123,386. Her average tax rate will be about 30 per cent and with TFSA income added back, she will have about $9,500 per month to spend, Egan estimates. Her present allocations of $15,700 per month, which cover her home and two rental units, would plummet with sale of her house. Her costs would drop by $1,840 for her home mortgage and perhaps $2,000 per month for taxes and maintenance. If she retires, she would end her $2,125 monthly RRSP contribution, cutting costs to $9,735. When her car lease, $868 per month, ends, she could choose a simpler car and save $500 per month. Her after-tax income would exceed spending. This financial projection is for 25 years. “We hope that Nancy will have all that time to enjoy what she has earned, but given her serious condition, she may wish to make gifts to her children and/or to good causes,” Egan explains.",

        "The mystery of what makes a joke funny – but only to some people",
      post_text:
        "How do you like the following joke from Sumeria in about 1900BC? “Something which has never occurred since time immemorial; a young woman did not fart in her husband’s lap.” Or this classic from Egypt, 1600BC? “How do you entertain a bored pharaoh? You sail a boatload of young women dressed only in fishing nets down the Nile and urge the pharaoh to go catch a fish.” If not, maybe try this more modern joke from 1000AD Britain: “What hangs at a man’s thigh and wants to poke the hole that it’s often poked before? Answer: A key.” The chances are you could tell these were meant to be funny, but did they make you laugh or smile? Be it ancient or modern day humour, we all find different things funny – why is this? Is it down to our brains or to the ways that humour works? One consistent finding in scientific studies is that laughter is universal and predates humans, while humour seems to appear alongside modern humans – wherever there is a record of modern humans, one finds jokes. There is a whole book of Roman Jokes, The Laughter Lover, which contains zingers including this one: “An Abderite [people from a region now split between Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey that the Romans thought were stupid] saw a eunuch talking with a woman and asked him if she was his wife. When he replied that eunuchs can’t have wives, the Abderite asked: ‘So is she your daughter?’”. It’s extremely interesting that, although the Sumerian farting joke is slightly over my head, they are all structured as jokes would be now. Even the topics seem modern – such as fart jokes and sex gags. These themes also confirm some of the scientific theories of jokes and humour. For example, humour often involves the realisation of incongruity (mismatch) between a concept and a situation, violations of social taboos or expectations, the resolution of tension or mocking and a sense of superiority (here, over those stupid Aberdites!). Social context But, even if jokes tend to be structured in a certain way, over time and place no one thing is guaranteed to make everyone laugh. Some of this is because time and distance rob the jokes of their cultural meaning Similarly, a recent study of jokes told by medical doctors in France showed that these often relied on pretty broad sweeping (or down right offensive) stereotypes – for example that surgeons are megalomaniac tyrants, that anaesthetists are lazy and that psychiatrists are mentally ill. Within the workplace, especially in stressful jobs, humour is often used to encourage cohesion within a group in order to deal with stress in an acceptable way. But it also works to exclude outsiders, who can find such humour to be unpalatably dark. This last point is important – exclusion of others can help boost group cohesion. Read more: Is there such a thing as a national sense of humour? We are all part of different social groups, and that will affect our approach to humour. Because as well as reflecting culturally shared values, comedy reflects our aspirations and our sense of what we would like to find funny. Charlie Chaplin is still extremely popular in China, whereas in the West we can appreciate him artistically but we don’t often find his comedy makes us laugh – it seems old-fashioned and predictable. Even worse, one of the most successful comedians inspired by Chaplin, Benny Hill, is considered cringeworthy in the UK, despite him being one of the few UK comedians to break through in the USA. That’s because Brits like to think that they are a bit more sophisticated in their humour than a man being chased around by naughtily-dressed ladies. In this context, it’s not at all unusual for older people to find the things that younger people find funny to be entirely inexplicable. When my colleagues and I ran an event at the Royal Society and the Big Bang fair in 2012-13, we asked attendees (mostly teenagers) what made them laugh and were mystified that a common response was “KSI”. We had to google this to find out that he’s an extremely popular YouTuber. And when I watched him I was frankly none the wiser, but I also strongly suspect that he’s not going to be shedding any tears about this as he has more than 20m subscribers on YouTube. And I suspect that if my generation found KSI hilarious, he would be less funny to young people. My son (13) is currently obsessed with watching YouTube compilations of Vines (the now defunct short video social media site): he was horrified when I told him that I used to have a Vine account. Ugh, mum! So all this variation in what we find funny has much less to do with Vines, KSI and me, and more to do with something that happens as we all get older: younger people come along and they can have radically different ideas about what is musical, what is fashionable, and – critically for this article – what is funny. They are their own exclusive group. Brain networks The fact that humour is about social bonding and cohesion – whether this comes from relieving stress or bullying others – is supported by neuroscience. Humour in the brain rests on very similar networks to those that support human language comprehension in a more general sense. Common areas of activation for humorous material include the anterior temporal lobes, which are closely associated with the representation of semantic meaning, and the temporal-parietal junction and superior frontal lobes, which are often activated when we need to think about what things mean and how words can relate to each other. Humour and communication overlap in the brain. SpeedKingz/Shutterstock One study argued that the superior frontal gyrus was critical to the appreciation of the humour in a joke and that stimulating this region with direct electrical currents makes jokes seem funnier. However, as shown, these regions are seen in other tasks too. So it may be hard to dissociate our sense of humour from our ability to process both linguistic meaning and social meaning. And it’s not hard to see why evolution would have favoured this – humans who collaborate successfully using understanding of the world and other humans have better chances of survival. So what does make a joke funny? We have made great strides in understanding the scientific bases on laughter and humour processing – but until we can incorporate the social and cultural complexities of humour fully, we will remain mystified by how people can enjoy comedy we find lame.",

        "When WWI, Pandemic and Slump Ended, Americans Sprung Into the Roaring Twenties",
      post_text:
        "The unprecedented death and destruction wrought by World War I leveled economies the world over, but the situation was different in the United States. In fact, 1914 to 1918 were mostly boom years for the U.S. as the federal government poured money into the wartime economy. Previously a debtor nation, the U.S. emerged from the war as a chief lender and arguably the strongest and most vibrant economy in the world. But even that wartime boom doesn’t fully explain what happened next. Somehow, despite a global flu pandemic that killed 675,000 Americans in 1918 and 1919, and a depression that gutted the economy in 1920 and 1921, the United States not only recovered but entered into a decade of unprecedented growth and prosperity. Americans began a spending spree: the Roaring Twenties was on. WATCH: The Spanish Flu Was Deadlier Than WWI The ‘Boomlet’ Before the Bust The Federal Reserve, created in 1913, flexed its monetary policy muscles for the first time during World War I. Since the American public was unwilling to fund the war effort through taxes, the Fed did it by printing more money. The result by 1918 was runaway inflation. A pair of shoes that cost $3 before the war now cost $10 or $12. Economists predicted a post-war crash as military factory orders dried up after the 1918 Armistice. Compounding the end of the wartime economy was the spread of the so-called “Spanish flu,” a virulent contagion which not only killed hundreds of thousands of Americans from the fall of 1918 to the spring of 1919, but shuttered businesses from coast to coast. Incredibly, the dire post-war economic predictions didn’t come true. At least not immediately. American consumers, who had patriotically scrimped and saved during wartime, began to live it up. Europeans also joined in, purchasing $8 billion in exports from America. Inflation ticked upward, and so did prices, but consumers were willing to pay anything for a taste of freedom. “Instead of the deflationary slump widely expected, the economy experienced an inflationary boomlet, and everybody exhaled,” says James Grant, the author of The Forgotten Depression: 1921: The Crash that Cured Itself. “The inevitable did happen, but it didn’t happen on schedule.” Not ‘Great,’ But Still a Depression New York Stock Exchange, 1920 Interior of New York Stock Exchange, circa 1920. To combat skyrocketing inflation, the Fed kept raising its discount interest rate to make borrowing more expensive. By 1920, the interest rate had reached 7 percent, what Grant calls “horrifically high.” While the Fed had the right idea, the timing was not good. The surprise post-war inflationary bubble was about to burst. Sector by sector, market by market, prices began to plummet as the once-exuberant consumer demand dried up. And with interest rates sky high, businesses couldn’t afford to borrow money to stay afloat. Grant argues that the Fed absolutely could have intervened by slashing interest rates, and Congress could have passed fat stimulus packages to prop up failing industries, but instead, U.S. leaders chose the path of laissez-faire. Benjamin Strong, the influential governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at the time, was clear-eyed in his prediction of what inaction would do to the economy. “I believe that this period will be accompanied by a considerable degree of unemployment, but not for very long,” he wrote in February of 1919. “And that after a year or two of discomfort, embarrassment, some losses, some disorders caused by unemployment, we will emerge with an almost invincible banking position… and be able to exercise a wide and important influence in restoring the world to a normal and livable condition.” And that’s precisely what happened. The depression of 1920 and 1921 lasted 18 months, what Grant calls a “brutally hard, but very efficient depression.” The stock market lost nearly half its value, unemployment reached 19 percent, and countless businesses went bankrupt, including Truman & Jacobson, a men’s clothing store in Kansas City co-owned by future U.S. president Harry Truman. A Nation ‘On Sale’ The bitter economic pill prescribed by Strong worked as intended, and prices came down. And in 1921, the newly appointed Secretary of the Treasury, wealthy industrialist Andrew Mellon, pressed the Fed to finally lower interest rates. With deflated prices for goods and lower borrowing costs, “The country was on sale,” says Grant. Foreign investors flooded the economy with gold and that provided the capital to get the ball rolling again domestically. “Free markets were their own beacon,” says Grant. “Gold rushed into the country to profit by the coming boom, and sure enough there was a boom, and the 1920s really ‘roared.’” Back to ‘Normal’ in a Big Way Ford Factory, 1928 Assembly line workers inside the Ford Motor Company factory at Dearborn, Michigan, 1928. The Roaring Twenties deserves its name—the U.S. economy grew by 42 percent from 1921 to 1929. But economic historians argue that the factors that made the decade so profitable were less of an anomaly than a return to normalcy. Even the biggest technological advances of the 1920s—widespread electrification of homes and factories, the introduction of household appliances like refrigerators and washing machines, rapid adoption of the automobile, the growth of commercial radio stations and cinemas—were in development before World War I hit the “pause” button. “The war may have accelerated development of aircraft, but in general, in the 1920s you got back to normal economic growth and normal economic business cycle,” says Hugh Rockoff, a professor of economic history at Rutgers University. The Roar of the Roaring Twenties Is Silenced Much of the skyrocketing wealth of the 1920s was built on a shaky foundation of easy credit and stock market speculation. The same laissez-faire governing philosophy that righted the economic ship in 1921 failed to avert the 1929 stock market crash and prevent unregulated American banks from going belly up. After a great exhale following war and pandemic, Americans now faced the Great Depression.",
